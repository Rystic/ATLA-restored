#First event.

#Preparation event: pick co-hunter. (strong, loyal, smart)
#Preparation event II: make sacrifice to endear gods. (warpaint/tattoo application) - Start setting variable to determine how well the hunt is going.

#Begin hunt.

#Flavor events: (increasing/decreasing hunt variable)
## Character is about to fall/drown/random. (might result in Friendship/Rivalry/Love)
## Characters looking for tracks. (intrigue)
## Characters need to examine carcass killed by target. (martial)
## Characters reflect upon their target. (learning)
## Characters find hermit, ask info on target. (diplomacy)
## Characters need to interpret old map and pathways. (stewardship)

## Lunatic/Possessed character goes on a Wild Hunt and kills partner.

#Prey is found and fought:
#If variable is too low, hunt will simply fail before this (prey will not be found).
#If variable is mid value, chance of wounding, loss of co-hunter.
#If the variable is high value, easy win.

#Post-hunting: pick trophy/take eagle egg to train (Tengri only).

#Taking eagle pet.
