Wonders are buildings that players need to invest a lot of resource and time into, but they are very powerful. They are built in four successive stages. Each stage may unlock new slots in which the player may construct upgrades.

Wonder syntax:
<wonder_name> = { # The unique identifier of the wonder type. For example pyramid, great_library.
	available_upgrades = { <upgrade_name> <upgrade_name> } # A list of upgrades that are available for construction in this wonder. Choose upgrades from the common/wonder_upgrades folder.
	picture = GFX_wonder_cathedral # The gfx entry to use for this wonder
	stage = { # defines values for the first stage. Required. Stages are order dependent.
		build_time = 12 # Defines how long the base build time is in months.
		gold_cost_flat = 500 # Defines how much gold will be deducted when the stage construction is initiated.
		gold_cost_ticking = 10 # Defines how much gold will be deducted at the end of each month
		upgrade_slots = 2 # Defines how many new upgrade slots the stage makes available.
	}
	stage = { # Same syntax as stage 1. Required.
	}
	stage = { # Same syntax as stage 1. Required.
	}
	stage = { # Same syntax as stage 1. Required.
	}
	is_in_water = yes # Is the wonder placed in water? Will override province terrain graphics with water background.
