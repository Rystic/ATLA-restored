# The entry should be named in the same way that the elective succession law is named to define it's voter's logic.
# Root scope - Voter, the character voting in the election
# From scope - Candidate, Character considered for the title
# FromFrom scope - The title the nomination is for ALSO FUCKING RULER REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
# FromFromFrom scope - The title owner's candidate
