Artifact spawns, decides which items are spawned at the begining of the game.

variables:

spawn_chance:
	mtth, to decide whether an artifact spawn should execute or not. Range is 0-100. Default behavior is to always spawn.

	example: a 50% chance to execute an artifact spawn
	spawn_chance = {
		value = 50
	}

weight:
	mtth, character scope, evaluates a potential artifact holder score, which is then used for randomizing who gets an artifact. Default behavior is for everyone to have the same chance.

	example: only christians have a chance of getting an artifact
	weight = {
		value = 0
		additive_modifier = {
			value = 100
			religion_group = christian
		}
	}

max_amount:
	integer, how many artifacts do we hand out? default is 4,294,967,295

spawn_date:
	date, what date should it claim to have been created? Note that this could be in the future; the spawn chance should be handled in spawn_chance. If a date at or before 1.1.1 is used, it'll state "Unknown Date"

artifacts:
	A list of keys and MTTH for which artifact is spawned.

	example: 50% chance that the person will get a golden_platypus
	artifacts ={
		golden_platypus = {
			value = 1
		}
		crystal_platypus = {
			value = 1
		}
	}
