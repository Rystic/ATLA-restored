EVTTITMAND3;Conqueror;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAND3;After series of conquests, your campaign has finally come to an end, and thus you are the rightful ruler of Earth Kingdom! Now, as the new ruler of an entire nation, you need to choose a dynasty for ensuring your legitimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAND5;Your weak rulership over Earth Kingdom has degraded your authority. Because of that, the Bureaucratic faction has seized power. Now you are nothing more than a puppet king, without even the right to leave palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAND6;Our bureaucratic laws have degraded because of your inability to uphold the Earth Kingdom's authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMAND15;A ruler that is diligent is indeed a good ruler -- your responsible ways of ruling help maintain the respect of the entire Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAND16;Vassals should bend to their rulers, while a ruler must stand firm! -- Your content and unsure ways of ruling don't do any favours to your tenure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMAND17;You are a rare breed -- a Monarch who knows everyone's name! You captivate those around you when you speak, and your subjects look forward to the one-on-one time you afford each of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCMAND25;Although you find it virtuous, those around you see your trusting nature as being hopelessly naive, and imagine you unfit to lead the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
