# Events

A_PUSH_BACK_TITLE;A Push Back;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_PUSH_BACK_DESC;Fed up with the incessant raids along the coastline, the barbarians of the northern Earth Kingdom have begun to push back, kidnapping and executing all water benders they come across. Although sparse, their attacks are vicious, and this ruthlessness is enough to spure soldiers to amass on their own accord, in hopes of fighting back against the tribal menace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_PUSH_BACK_BARBARISM_OPTION;We will take back our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_PUSH_BACK_WATERBENDER_OPTION;Petty tribals. They won't stand in our way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_PUSH_BACK_NON_BARBARISM_OPTION;Just a meaningless squabble between tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

A_SHOW_OF_FORCE;A Show of Force;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_SHOW_OF_FORCE_DESC;Emboldened by their success, the barbaric rulers of the northern Earth Kingdom have made their vendetta official -- they will settle for nothing less than the absolute routing of the Northern Water Tribe from their lands, and the extinction of waterbenders among their people. To that end, a new call to arms has been declared, and the righteous among the barbarian populace gather in preperation to retake the coastal land lost to the invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_SHOW_OF_FORCE_BARBARISM_OPTION;The time has come to drive out the invaders!;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_SHOW_OF_FORCE_WATERBENDER_OPTION;They don't understand who they're dealing with.;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_SHOW_OF_FORCE_NON_BARBARISM_OPTION;Just a meaningless squabble between tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

THE_REVERSE_INVASION;The Reverse Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;x
THE_REVERSE_INVASION_DESC;Having fought the enemy in their stolen lands, and learning from the technology abandoned in their retreat, the barbarian leaders of the northern Earth Kingdom have mastered shipbuilding, and intend to take their war to the Northern Water Tribe. Praying to their primitive forest spirits, they set sail in their simple boats, fully intending to drive their enemies to eradication.;;;;;;;;;;;x
THE_REVERSE_INVASION_BARBARISM_OPTION;Crush their walls! Shatter their cities!;;;;;;;;;;;x
THE_REVERSE_INVASION_WATERBENDER_OPTION;They seek to breach our walls? Pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
THE_REVERSE_INVASION_NON_BARBARISM_OPTION;Just a meaningless squabble between tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

PRIDE_OF_THE_NORTH;Pride of the North;;;;;;;;;;;x
PRIDE_OF_THE_NORTH_DESC;All along the northern coast of the Earth Kingdom, the Barbarbian tribes swell with a well-earned pride. Having driven off their foes, and staged grand public executions of the ones they captured, the very culture of these primitive people has changed. Once seen as just a nuisance, now a true strength has emerged, and the gleam of a formidable nation begins to shine. The Water Tribes would do well to handle these savages, lest the situation reach a point of no return.;;;;;;;;;;;x
PRIDE_OF_THE_NORTH_BARBARISM_OPTION;We are a nation, and we shall be feared.;;;;;;;;;;;x
PRIDE_OF_THE_NORTH_WATERBENDER_OPTION;They're still just lawless barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;x
PRIDE_OF_THE_NORTH_NON_BARBARISM_OPTION;Just a meaningless squabble between tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

A_HIGHER_CALLING;A Higher Calling;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_HIGHER_CALLING_DESC;Seeing resounding success in their campaign against the Water Tribes, the Barbarians of the North have reached a crossroad -- as their victories are a clear sign of divine favor, do they continue to pursue their ancient vendetta, and hold on to their hate? Or do they abandon their blood feud for a chance at forming a real nation, blessed by their strange forest spirits? Only the most pious among their rulers is fit to make such a decision, and the world waits with bated breath to see what emerges from the Barbarians' newfound piety.;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_HIGHER_CALLING_BARBARISM_OPTION;We must decide our fate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_HIGHER_CALLING_WATERBENDER_OPTION;They will never be a true nation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
A_HIGHER_CALLING_NON_BARBARISM_OPTION;Just a meaningless squabble between tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT;Wanting to make a public show of your power, you drudge up one of your imprisoned Waterbenders. Surrounded by your advisors, you must decide the heathen's fate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_NORMAL;A simple execution will suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_EARTHBENDING;I will kill the prisoner with Earthbending!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_DUEL;Three days from now, we shall duel!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_SACRIFICE;We'll sacrifice this heretic to the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_NORMAL_BAD_EVENT;Not having the stomach for the gruesomeness of a bloody execution, you sentence the Waterbender to be hanged. The tribesfolk, hungry for brutality, seem unimpressed, and disperse shortly after the deed is done. Although satisfied with how you handled the situation, you can't help but feel you missed an opportunity to bring more people over to your side.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_OPTION_BAD;It is finished.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_NORMAL_NEUTRAL_EVENT;Grabbing your axe, you bellow "I shall do the deed myself!". Marching to the center of camp, you see the squirming Waterbender, held down by your guards. Cursing [his/her] people and all they've done to yours, you lift the axe high before dropping it with a loud THUNK -- one swing is enough to leave your prisoner headless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_OPTION_NEUTRAL;A fine swing, if I do say so myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_NORMAL_GOOD_TITLE;The Boiling Pit;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_NORMAL_GOOD_EVENT;With a vile glee, you announce to your prisoner [his/her] means of execution -- to be boiled alive in scalding water. For a moment, hope washes over the them, and when finally the time comes, the Waterbender breaks their loose restraints, and begins the motions of bending. But you knew this would happen, you instructed the restraints loosened, and you are not so gullible to give your ancient foe a weapon so easily. Smiling in delight, you watch the bender desperately try to move the boiling oil, and relish their surprise moments later as they are shoved in and killed with little resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_OPTION_GOOD;The price for looking down on us.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EARTHBENDING_BAD_EVENT;Tying your prisoner to a stake at the center of the camp, you begin the arduous task of using your earthbending to pelt them to death with rocks. Your advisors ask if you need any help, and several hours in, the thought does sound very appealing. However, this task is your burden to bear. After an excruciating amount of time, you take stock of the corpse of the once-Waterbender. However, the sun has long since set, and most of the crowd has already gone home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EARTHBENDING_EVENT_OPTION_BAD;Where did everybody go?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EARTHBENDING_NEUTRAL_EVENT;Your prisoner lays tied and buckled in-front of you, cursing your name and making other guttural noises, but you ignore these and assume your proper bending-form. Suddenly, two giant stone walls emerge from both sides of the Waterbender, and begin moving towards them at an alarming speed. It only takes a few moments before you hear a satifying crunch, and blood begins to pool at the base of the now-single wall.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EARTHBENDING_EVENT_OPTION_NEUTRAL;Executed with impunity!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EARTHBENDING_GOOD_TITLE;The Casket of Stone;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EARTHBENDING_GOOD_EVENT;"Release the prisoner of their bindings", you coldly announce, to the surprise of those around you. Concerned at the command, but still bound in their obedience, your guards do it. The Waterbender stares at you confused, but only for a moment, as you lift an open palm and clench your fist, before pulling your entire arm down. The ground beneath them becomes unstable, and they begins to sink into the floor. Flailing, desperately trying to grab anything, the Waterbender tries to escape, but nothing can save them now. Eventually, the almost-liquified floor swallows [his/her] entire body, and as a final act of cruelty, you once again solidify the ground. So simple, yet so gruesome, you see even some of your own people wincing at the thought of being put into such a casket of stone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EARTHBENDING_EVENT_OPTION_GOOD;Simply a master demonstrating their craft.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_DUEL_BAD_EVENT;To ensure victory, you tell your advisors the night before to break the Waterbender's arms and legs. Despite this, the match is somehow still even -- your frail body versus their intentionally broken one. At the end, you emerge victorious, but the victory is pyrrhic, at best. All across the tribe, people mock the chief who could barely hold his own against a prisoner with shattered bones.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_DUEL_OPTION_BAD;Well he's dead, isn't he?!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_DUEL_NEUTRAL_EVENT;The morning of the duel comes, and you feel confident in your victory. The Waterbender is slightly drugged, but not enough that it would be obvious to the crowd. Once the fight starts, you feel the true heat of battle -- there is no bending present, only raw strength, as it should be. After almost an hour of combat, your opponent falls to the ground, and you deliver the finishing blow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_DUEL_OPTION_NEUTRAL;Bow to my strength!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_DUEL_GOOD_TITLE;The Wall of Meat;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_DUEL_GOOD_EVENT;Your advisors ask if you want to make any... preperations... on the prisoner before your duel, but you brush them off -- cheating is for weaklings, not those fit to rule. When the day of the fight finally arrives, the Waterbender stares in abject horror at the absolute wall of meat and muscle approaching them. The fight doesn't last long -- grabbing your opponent by the head, you lift them into the air. Pushing your other hand against their temple, you squeeze until you hear a grisly crack. The crowd didn't expect to see a beheading today, but by god, you gave them one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_DUEL_OPTION_GOOD;Pathetic.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_SACRIFICE_BAD_EVENT;Few showed up to the morning's sacrifice, as your impiety is well known among the populace, and even the most fanatic priests refused to believe this was anything more than a show. Not gaining yourself any traction with your tribe, you begin thinking that even with the best intentions, playing the part of holy man might not be right for you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_SACRIFICE_OPTION_BAD;The life of the clergy bores me.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_SACRIFICE_NEUTRAL_EVENT;As the ceremony commences, the humdrum chanting of the clergymen is complemented by the screams of the burning Waterbender. Looking over your tribe, you see you've pulled in a decent crowd, ready to watch a violent end to their ancient enemy. You might not be the most pious, but it lifts the spirits of those around you to see, given so many options for execution, that you chose you to make it a religious affair. Perhaps it's not too late to court the gods to your side?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_SACRIFICE_OPTION_NEUTRAL;The gods will know I respect them.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_SACRIFICE_GOOD_TITLE;The Blessed Visitation;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_SACRIFICE_GOOD_EVENT;Everyone seems to be in good spirits for today's offering -- as they should, as you have spared no expense. For the glory of the gods, you have set out a grand feast, as a display of the bounty of your faith. Within the crowds, your priests are on patrol, entertaining the children with stories and proselytizing the adults. When the time finally comes to burn the Waterbender, you set the flame at [his/heer] feet, only to see it immediately rise into an unnatural pillar of fire, with the sounds of Spirits cackling and howling in delight all around it. When the flame dies down, all that remains are charred bones. So overwhelmed with what was witnessed, the crowd is silent, until finally the priests begin chanting "A Blessed Visitation! A Blessed Visitation!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
EXECUTE_WATERBENDER_EVENT_SACRIFICE_OPTION_GOOD;A blessed visitation!;;;;;;;;;;;x

REFORM_BARBARISM_TITLE;The Barbaric Reformation;;;;;;;;;;;x
REFORM_BARBARISM_DESC;As your barely-literate priests bark holy edicts over one another, you let out a rabid, guttural sound to get their attention. The time has finally come for a decision: follow the Old Ways? Or carve a new path for your people?;;;;;;;;;;;x
REFORM_BARBARISM_OLD_WAYS_EFFECTS;§G+10§! §YMoral Authority§! for §G50§! years. Become religious head of §YBarbarism§!.§YProselytizing§! is more effective. §RBarbarian Vendetta§! now can target any §YWaterbender§!, at any location, and targets §YDukedoms§!. Increase success rate of §GSettle Tribe§!, especially in counties with any §YWater-culture§!.;;;;;;;;;;;x
REFORM_BARBARISM_NEW_PATH_EFFECTS;§G+10§! §YMoral Authority§! for §G50§! years.Become religious head of §YBarbarism§!. §YProselytizing§! is more effective. §YBarbarism§! rulers may use §YCounty Conquest§! against any opponent. Increase success rate of §GSettle Tribe§!.;;;;;;;;;;;x
REFORM_BARBARISM_OLD_WAYS_TITLE;Venerate the Old Ways!;;;;;;;;;;;x
REFORM_BARBARISM_OLD_WAYS_DESC;And so the barbarians in the north, successful in their campaign against the Waterbenders of the Northern Water Tribe, have decreed their hate be codified into their faith. Choosing to venerate the old ways, their once-coastal raids have turned into a full-fledged Holy War against Waterbenders across the world. Sailing beyond the icy lands of the north, these barbarians find themselves pillaging the coast of the Serpent's Pass, delving deep into the Swamp, and even plundering their enemy's sister tribe in the south. To their ancient foes, there shall be no sanctuary.;;;;;;;;;;;x

REFORM_BARBARISM_NEW_PATH_TITLE;Carve a New Path!;;;;;;;;;;;x
REFORM_BARBARISM_NEW_PATH_DESC;And so the barbarians in the north, successful in their campaign against the Waterbenders of the Northern Water Tribe, have decreed their blood feud come to an end. Having so badly beaten their opponents that they seem a non-threat, these savages look to the south for new lands to conquer. Although it feels like like a part of their culture has been forsaken, in truth, a new, proud people have emerged from the once blood-addled populace. These warriors seek new horizons, and are eager to settle lands beyond the mountains they've always known.;;;;;;;;;;;x
