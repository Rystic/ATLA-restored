#Events
SLAVE_REINSTATE_TITLE;Slavery Reinstated;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
event_slavery_instated_pirate;You give a sickly smile, watching dark clouds bellow from the forge into the sky. Every smith in the city is hard at work, but there's no armor to be made, nor weapons. Instead, you watch as the hammer comes down on a fresh pair of manacles, still red from the furnace. Just a few now, but soon, as many pairs as you need. Overcome with a horrendous glee, you feel as though you're bearing witness to the start of something much larger than yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
SLAVE_REINSTATE_OPTION_PIRATE;The Earth Kingdom has so many people... why not share them?;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

event_slavery_instated_not_pirate;Dark rumors have found their way to your court, as word has reached you that slavery is making a resurgence in the Eastern Sea. Once exterminated - first by Avatar Kyoshi's resounding victory over the Fifth Nation, second by a cooperative effort among the Four Nations to liberate the remaining slave holdouts - no sign of the practice has been witnessed in decades. If left unchecked, this market could swell in power, and lead to a complete rebirth of the outlaw-nation.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
SLAVE_REINSTATE_OPTION_NOT_PIRATE;This barbaric practice must be abolished!;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

ORGANIZE_CARTEL_TITLE;Birth of a Cartel;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
ORGANIZE_CARTEL_OPTION;"Some are born with the Divine Right to rule. I plundered it.";;;;;;;;;;;x;;
organize_cartel_event;It seems so long ago that you and your mateys sailed shore-to-shore, plundering taverns of their ale, then cities of their loot, living wherever the wind chose. Now, gazing out the window of your seaside manor, you can't help but think how irresistable a place like this would have been to pillage. But those thoughts are behind you now -- the winds have changed, and so too path of piracy. Gathered around you, your puppet governors approach one-by-one, swearing their fealty to your family and all its glory. No longer are you the captain of some wayward pirate fleet, but a King among outlaws, and your rule is absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

BLACK_MARKET_ESTABLISHED_TITLE;Black Market Established;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
BLACK_MARKET_OPTION;Mum's the word.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
event_black_market_established;You'd never think anything was out of the ordinary, wandering the market. Bustling crowds, merchants screaming over one another pushing their wares, the humdrum sounds of life in all directions. But you know the signs. A trader blinking a strange pattern. A quick hand gesture there, followed by a tap on the nose. Suddenly, a homeless man approaches you and horsely belts out "got any coin of the Four nations?". You quietly say back "No, but I have of the Fifth". Cracking a gummy smile, the destitute man whispers "Please, my Lord, follow me".;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

CHARTER_FLEET_SMALL_TITLE;Handful of Ships;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
CHARTER_FLEET_SMALL_OPTION;We've got a lot of work ahead of us...;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
charter_fleet_small_desc;Striding out onto the dock with a setting sun behind you, you take stock of a handful of battle-worn ships. They're not the most impressive you've seen, but considering the strings you had to pull to get them, they could be much worse. Following behind you, the shipwright responsible for their acquisition fidgets with antipication, as if preparing to be scolded. "Where did they come from?", you ask. "Wherever we could find them, my Lord. Some off the coast of the Southern tribes. Most fell apart on the way back." You grumble, but considering the kind of fleet you're building, this isn't an unusual start. "Fine. Let's get to work repairing them. By the month's end, I want to set these down the coastline to attack the southern isles".;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

CHARTER_FLEET_MEDIUM_TITLE;A Respectable Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
CHARTER_FLEET_MEDIUM_OPTION;At ease, shipwright.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
charter_fleet_medium_desc;"The numbers are respectable, Captain.", your shipwright murmurs. "Enough to carry a couple thousand buccaneers down the coast, at least". You quietly nod in agreement. Moments prior, you finished surveying your new retinue of ships down at the harbor. Now, you stand with your shipwright at the drydock, overseeing some repairs. "So how did you find these ships, Simon?". He shrugs. "Some bought. Some stolen. Others build from scratch". You're impressed that the Black Market can commission a fleet of this girth, although given the rekindled interest in slavery, they have considerably more pull than they once did. "Excellent, alert me when the repairs to the.. forcefully acquired.. ships are complete. I want to be out on the water as soon as possible".;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

CHARTER_FLEET_LARGE_TITLE;A Navy for a King;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
CHARTER_FLEET_LARGE_OPTION;Let's not waste any time. To adventure, and plunder!;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
charter_fleet_large_desc;Beaming with pride, your shipwright gestures you towards a nearby pier and bellows "this way to your fleet, my Lord". You knew the Black Market would provide, but never in your wildest dreams did you expect this. What's waiting for you at the dock isn't just a fleet -- it's a Navy. The sort fit for Kings, and Emperors. The kind that used to transport armies, not just sail a bunch of plundering hooligans port-to-port. You gawk, as your mind runs wild with thinking how you would even put such a fleet to use. Gradually, your fixation on the ships wanes, and you finally manage to speak. "Are... all of these mine?". With what teeth he has left, the shipwright smiles, and says "Of course they are, Captain".;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

FIFTH_NATION_RESTORED_TITLE;Fifth Nation Restored;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
FIFTH_NATION_RESTORED_PRIATE_OPTION;Generations of effort have lead to our glorious revival!;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
FIFTH_NATION_RESTORED_NOT_PIRATE_OPTION;A new Pirate King? These monsters must be put down.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
fifth_nation_restored_event_desc;After letting piracy fester for too long, the greatest fear of the Four Nations has come to pass - the Fifth Nation, one of cruelty and deceit, has been restored under a new Pirate King. No longer operating in the shadows, the Fifth Nation openly practices slavery, and has its sights set on pillaging the entirety of the Earth Kingdom coastline. With newfound organization, a robust underground market for fencing illegal goods, and droves of once-lawless provinces falling into line, it's hard to say if anyone -- even a new Avatar -- can stop their rise to power.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;

YOU_ARE_A_PIRATE_TITLE;A Pirate's Life for Me!;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
event_you_are_a_pirate;Wind at your back lads, wherever you go! You are a pirate!;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
YOU_ARE_A_PIRATE_OPTION;Hang the black flag at the end of the mast!;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
