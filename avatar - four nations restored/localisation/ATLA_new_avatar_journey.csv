EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_2_water;I was already starting to pack my things, but soon the elders came and told me that I wouldn't need worldly things anymore. Before they left, they left a gift, a basket of fruit and a stack of ring-like coins. That should be enough for the journey and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_2_air;I was already starting to pack my things, but soon the elders came and told me that I wouldn't need worldly things anymore.

EVTOPT_new_avatar_2_thanks;I appreciate it;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_2_asceticism;I am very grateful, but as you said, I will no longer need worldly things.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_2_greed;I beg your pardon, shouldn't the Avatar be treated with more reverence?;;;;;;;;;;;x



EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_3_water;A couple of days later, the elders came again. There wasn't much time left, and soon it would be time me to leave. They said there were several ships lined up at the port.

# WATER TRIBES

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_100_to_water_tribes;Journey to The Water Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_100_to_water_tribes;Water tribes spread out over the South and North Poles. Once upon a time, the Water Tribes were one united nation under the North, but then some of the people migrated to the South, and founded the Southern Water Tribe.\nThe North, under a single leader, has always been more hierarchical, and women have traditionally been forbidden to learn the fighting styles of waterbending, they have been taught healing.\nThe South, on the other hand, was divided into many independent chiefdoms, allowed women to learn fighting styles, but was less developed than the North.;;;;;;;;;;;x

new_avatar_journey.106.title;The Legend of Tui and La;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.106.desc;After the first day of my training, Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] approached and said, "It's time to tell you about the nature of the Waterbeding.\nThe legends say the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides, and learned how to do it themselves. Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon (Tui), our life comes from the spirit of the ocean (La). They work together to keep balance. If you learn to imitate the moon, your understanding of waterbending will improve greatly.\nIf you want to learn more about waterbending, you'll have to wait a few more days until the next full moon.";;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.106.opt;Thank you teacher;;;;;;;;;;;x

new_avatar_journey.107.desc;A couple of days later, after another training session, when I was about to go to my quarters, Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] stopped me and led to the chieftain's palace courtyard.\nA huge wooden door concealed the entrance to a mysterious, very strange place: in the middle of the icy mountains there was a warm oasis in which two fish were swimming, and around it grew grass and trees.\nMaster explained, "This place is a centre for all the spiritual power of the North Pole."\nBy that time the full moon had set, and you felt a mixture of calm, contentment, and a burst of energy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.107.opt;It's so... peaceful here;;;;;;;;;;;x

new_avatar_journey.108.title;Meditation;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.108.desc;The Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] tells you not to forget that you have come here to learn, not to have fun. He then sits down beside the pond in a meditation pose and tells you to do the same. You obey.\nThe Master says, "Well, now concentrate on the movement of these two koi fish. They were the ones that once taught me, perhaps they will teach you too." And adds: "Don't forget your breathing."\nAfter a while, you feel something special. Everything around you is gone, there is no master, no grass, no trees. There is only water, the moon, and these two fish.\nAnd so you sit there until dawn, when the glare on the water brings you out of your trance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.108.opt;That was... Unforgettable...;;;;;;;;;;;x

new_avatar_journey.109.desc;After another training day, you go not to your chambers but to the sea, to watch the tides. After meditating on those koi fish, you feel you have finally begun to understand the waterbending nature.\nAfter an hour of observation, you recall the master's words that waterbending is based on pulling and pushing... You raise your hands, and... I've got it! Finally!\n"Congratulations, my apprentice," Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] suddenly appears.\nYou can't stand your feelings, "Thank you, Master! After meditating on the koi fish, I... I was..."\n"Yes, yes... since you've finally mastered the basics of bending, I'll expect you at practice at dawn as always. Good night.";;;;;;;;;;;x

Still, you go on, somehow putting one foot in front of the other, determined to finish the battle. Slowly, you come to realize that the waterbending you practiced for so long hasn't diminished, but only improved.\nBut it's too late, and you fail.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_400_travel_air_nomads;The Travel to Air Nomads;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_400_travel_air_nomads;On the path of the Avatar, the journey to one of the Main Four Air Temples was always one of the most difficult challenges. The Air Nomads live in isolation, their major centers located on four edges of the world: In the mountains, high above the sky, and under the cliffs, where they cannot be seen from the ground.\nSometimes they can be seen in the foothill towns or on islands like Kyoshi or Itakshir, where they ask for alms, or trade, buy food, and fly away. They would welcome a fellow traveller, It would not be out of place to say that once Avatar is nominated, they are among the first to send ambassadors, they treat teaching Avatar as one of their main goals in life.\n"By ship or by foot, always move against the Wind, to the places where it is born." - was the last thing I was told.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_401_arrival_on_whaletail;After months of sailing, the ship entered the foggy waters of Whaletail Island. The island was always surrounded by fogs, the air here was cold from the fast sea currents of the South Sea, and only high towers of temples on the hills saved ships from eternal wandering in frosty oblivion to the inevitable crash on the reefs.\nIt was rumoured that the fogs were created here by waterbenders to prevent ships of other nations from fishing here. Others considered this a manifestation of ancient spirits, like the Spirit of Mist, as ancient as the Spirits of the Moon and the Ocean.\nAlthough the air nomads do not like to settle on the coast, the fogs protected them as well as mountains and cliffs. The island has a tradition of fasting, and every summer hundreds and thousands of air nomads go on pilgrimage to this island, where Monk Tang Xu fasted for 98 days.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_401;Here, I think I'll find fellow travellers to the Southern Air Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_402_whaletail_temple;Hidden in the misty hills, a giant wooden temple was visible.\nA tall pagoda towered over the mist, indicating to skybison the location of the temple. Near the temple there were hundreds of living quarters on stilts. Skybison slept beneath them. There was a smell of incense everywhere, the fog held the smell in the air for many hours.\nThe temple seemed to be divided into two parts, connected by high bridges.\nAnd like the temple, there seemed to be two types of people.\nSome in the typical yellow-orange outfits of air nomads, and others completely in dark red, they stayed away from each other.\nThere was a vast market square around the pagoda, where nomads from all over the world exchanged goods.

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_403_whaletail_market;Here, they traded goods from all over the world. Famous fruit pies, whale and walrus bones, silk, paintings, oil, paper, scrolls and books. Moreover, coins of all four nations were used in the exchange. Currency exchange shops were especially successful. Natural exchange was also often used.\nIt turned out that many air nomads traded here on behalf of the Beifong house. Here was the postal center of air nomads, from ancient times, the Earth Kings hired them as messengers.\nNo one could imagine that without air nomads, the world trade would end...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_405_tang_xu_fast;The Tang Xu Festival was much different from anything I could have imagined. Usually at festivals there is a lot of food, sound and activity. But here you were able to listen only gong banging and eat lean food.\nMany people still were playing pai-sho. And a lot were seating around the pagoda meditating.\nOne monk called me to his pai-sho table, offered to play. "You're not from here, right?"\n"I also see that you are not an airbender. Or is it no longer customary in the 'free' commune to shave your head?"\nThe game went on while I was telling him my story.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_406_whaletail_customs;"Long ago, when airbenders flew not on skybison and gliders, but walked on the clouds, when our nation was young and proud, and the first statue of Wang had not yet been carved, there were those who did not hesitate to encroach on someone else's life. They worshiped hungry spirits in exchange for knowledge.\nMillennia later, after a long wandering in the spirit world, Guru Liu Xi recorded the history of air nomads. Guru Laghima, Shoken, and Liu Xi's historical notes have inspired a new generation of "free" folks, and the monk Tang Xu, without knowing it, found them a shelter here.\nThey eat meat and fish for Giant Koi for lamp oil. Our temple is divided into two parts, and the bridge between them will soon rot, which no one will notice. There are rumours of screams on the night of the Tang Xu festival, you won't be staying the night, are you?";;;;;;;;;;;x

The smell of incense was emitted in the same direction. The light shone in the direction of the "Free" commune. The streets were empty, was I the only one who was awakened by this?Coming closer, the gong began to complement the sonorous voices of prayers in a strange language. Not understanding the words, one could feel their antiquity, that these words were definitely not from this era.\nFollowing the sound, I went out to the square near the eastern part of the temple. Hundreds of monks in red robes sat and with closed eyes recited the mantra melodiously.\n"Would you like to join, wanderer?" said the same monk I spoke to during the day. "Soon the time of sacrifice will come, and whose voices He does not hear, He will take with Him.";;;;;;;;;;;x

As through the fog, as through the water, something was moving. I just noticed that the monk was talking with his eyes closed. Suddenly, he gave up his attempts, and sat down in his place, repeating the words of the ancients.\nThe sound of movement grew more and more, and a flying fish swam out of the forest. I felt a look on me, heavy and light at the same time.\nWhat am I doing here? What should I do? Is it a spirit? What kind of sacrifice? So many thoughts were running through my head. And something unlimited seemed to take control over me, something so familiar that it didn't take words to describe it. This was the first Avatar State.;;;;;;;;;;;x
