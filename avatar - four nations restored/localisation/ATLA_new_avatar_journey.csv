EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_1_fire;The Fire Sages told me about my training.\nI have to leave my own home, my Nation, my parents and friends, to see the World, to master all four elements, to become the True Avatar, to keep the balance in the Universe.\nFirst, I will go to the Air Nomads. There I will be taught not only airbending, but meditation and concentration.\nThen, to the Water Tribes. Water is the most difficult for fire avatars to master.\nThe Earth Kingdom is vast.

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_2;Worldly Things;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_2_water;I was already starting to pack my things, but soon the elders came and told me that I wouldn't need worldly things anymore. Before they left, they left a gift, a basket of fruit and a stack of ring-like coins. That should be enough for the journey and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_3_water;A couple of days later, the elders came again. There wasn't much time left, and soon it would be time me to leave. They said there were several ships lined up at the port.

# WATER TRIBES
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_100_to_water_tribes;Journey to The Water Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_100_to_water_tribes;Water tribes spread out over the South and North Poles. Once upon a time, the Water Tribes were one united nation under the North, but then some of the people migrated to the South, and founded the Southern Water Tribe.\nThe North, under a single leader, has always been more hierarchical, and women have traditionally been forbidden to learn the fighting styles of waterbending, they have been taught healing.\nThe South, on the other hand, was divided into many independent chiefdoms, allowed women to learn fighting styles, but was less developed than the North.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_100_to_water_tribes_nortern;I'm going to the Northern Water Tribe!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_101_northern_water_tribe;The Northen Water Tribe;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_101_northern_water_tribe;You arrive at the icy walls of Agna Qel'a, the capital of the Northern Water Tribe. You are welcomed by border guards and escorted to the chief's palace;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_101_northern_water_tribe;There is so much ice and snow here;;;;;;;;;;;x

new_avatar_journey.103.title;The Avatar Feast;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.103.desc;The feast took place in the palace of the Chief. Once everyone was assembled and seated, the drums rang out. A giant crab was dipped in boiling water in the center of the hall, and then the drums stopped. \nAnd after a short pause, the [northern_water_chief.GetTitledName] declared, "Today we celebrate the arrival of a very special guest... Avatar [GetFirstName]!"\nThe crowd clapped\n[northern_water_chief.GetSheHeCap] continued: And now Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] and his disciples will perform!;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.103.opt;Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey_104.title.nwt_teacher;Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey_104.desc;At the feast you are introduced to a waterbending master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName]. [waterbending_master.GetHerHis] said, "Good evening, Avatar. It is an honor for me to become your teacher."\nYou say, "Thank you, Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName]. It's an honor for me, too."\n[waterbending_master.GetHerHis] said, "Well, I expect you in the square tomorrow at dawn", and added, "and don't think that because tonight is a feast in your honor, you can be late". You bowed and went on celebrating.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey_104.opt;I finally found a teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.105.desc;Next morning you wake up at dawn and head to the square. When you arrive, you see Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] teaching waterbending to two young men. You walk over to them and you started your training.\nThe teacher puts you in sparring against his students time after time, and soon you start to be good at it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

You walk over to them and you started your training.\nTime after time the teacher puts you in sparring against his students, but you never succeed, and instead of water you always get just fire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.105.opt.1;Good sparring;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.105.opt.2;Teacher! I want to learn more about waterbending!!;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.106.title;The Legend of Tui and La;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.106.desc;After the first day of my training, Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] approached and said, "It's time to tell you about the nature of the Waterbeding.\nThe legends say the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides, and learned how to do it themselves. Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon (Tui), our life comes from the spirit of the ocean (La). They work together to keep balance. If you learn to imitate the moon, your understanding of waterbending will improve greatly.\nIf you want to learn more about waterbending, you'll have to wait a few more days until the next full moon.";;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.106.opt;Thank you teacher;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.107.title;Spirit Oasis;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.107.desc;A couple of days later, after another training session, when I was about to go to my quarters, Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] stopped me and led to the chieftain's palace courtyard.\nA huge wooden door concealed the entrance to a mysterious, very strange place: in the middle of the icy mountains there was a warm oasis in which two fish were swimming, and around it grew grass and trees.\nMaster explained, "This place is a centre for all the spiritual power of the North Pole."\nBy that time the full moon had set, and you felt a mixture of calm, contentment, and a burst of energy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.107.opt;It's so... peaceful here;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.108.title;Meditation;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.108.desc;The Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] tells you not to forget that you have come here to learn, not to have fun. He then sits down beside the pond in a meditation pose and tells you to do the same. You obey.\nThe Master says, "Well, now concentrate on the movement of these two koi fish. They were the ones that once taught me, perhaps they will teach you too." And adds: "Don't forget your breathing."\nAfter a while, you feel something special. Everything around you is gone, there is no master, no grass, no trees. There is only water, the moon, and these two fish.\nAnd so you sit there until dawn, when the glare on the water brings you out of your trance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.108.opt;That was... Unforgettable...;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.108.tooltip;§YYou feel your understanding of waterbending has improved§!;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.109.title;Pull and push;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.109.desc;After another training day, you go not to your chambers but to the sea, to watch the tides. After meditating on those koi fish, you feel you have finally begun to understand the waterbending nature.\nAfter an hour of observation, you recall the master's words that waterbending is based on pulling and pushing... You raise your hands, and... I've got it! Finally!\n"Congratulations, my apprentice," Master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] suddenly appears.\nYou can't stand your feelings, "Thank you, Master! After meditating on the koi fish, I... I was..."\n"Yes, yes... since you've finally mastered the basics of bending, I'll expect you at practice at dawn as always. Good night.";;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.109.opt;I'm a waterbender!;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.110.desc;Every morning you come to the square, where you spar with the students of teacher [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] until sunset.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.110.opt;Let's see what I've learned;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.111.title;Waterbending Sparring: Lose;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.111.desc;You spar time and time again, but your opponents never get tired. As time passes, you weaken. You begin to believe that you'll have to quit. Still, you go on, somehow putting one foot in front of the other, determined to finish the battle. Slowly, you come to realize that the waterbending you practiced for so long hasn't diminished, but only improved.\nBut it's too late, and you fail.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.111.opt;It's painful.;;;;;;;;;;;x

In a matter of seconds, your enemy falls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.112.opt;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.115.desc;After I defeated the best apprentice, the Master started to take me more seriously. Now I have to spar with the Master.;;;;;;;;;;;x

new_avatar_journey.116.title;Waterbending Sparring: Lose;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.116.desc;You engage again and again, but the master [waterbending_master.GetFirstName] dodges each of your attacks, and knocks you down with lightning speed. You know that he is no match for you, but you continue to attack anyway.\nFinally, you are exhausted, and he is able to take you down with a single strike.;;;;;;;;;;;x
new_avatar_journey.116.opt;It's painful...;;;;;;;;;;;x

new_avatar_journey.117.desc;You engage again and again, but the teacher dodges each of your attacks, and knocks you down with lightning speed. You know that he is no match for you, but you continue to attack anyway.\nBut after many sparrings, you begin to anticipate his moves, and dodge his attacks, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.\nAnd then, the moment comes. Your fight goes from city to sea, and with one powerful wave, you fling the Master back to the palace itself;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_400_travel_air_nomads;The Travel to Air Nomads;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_400_travel_air_nomads;On the path of the Avatar, the journey to one of the Main Four Air Temples was always one of the most difficult challenges. The Air Nomads live in isolation, their major centers located on four edges of the world: In the mountains, high above the sky, and under the cliffs, where they cannot be seen from the ground.\nSometimes they can be seen in the foothill towns or on islands like Kyoshi or Itakshir, where they ask for alms, or trade, buy food, and fly away. They would welcome a fellow traveller, It would not be out of place to say that once Avatar is nominated, they are among the first to send ambassadors, they treat teaching Avatar as one of their main goals in life.\n"By ship or by foot, always move against the Wind, to the places where it is born." - was the last thing I was told.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_400_southern_temple;I'll go to the Southern Temple, the greatest temple;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_400_eastern_temple;to the Eastern Temple, to the places of the first airbenders;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_401_arrival_on_whaletail;Arrival on Whaletail;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_401_arrival_on_whaletail;After months of sailing, the ship entered the foggy waters of Whaletail Island. The island was always surrounded by fogs, the air here was cold from the fast sea currents of the South Sea, and only high towers of temples on the hills saved ships from eternal wandering in frosty oblivion to the inevitable crash on the reefs.\nIt was rumoured that the fogs were created here by waterbenders to prevent ships of other nations from fishing here. Others considered this a manifestation of ancient spirits, like the Spirit of Mist, as ancient as the Spirits of the Moon and the Ocean.\nAlthough the air nomads do not like to settle on the coast, the fogs protected them as well as mountains and cliffs. The island has a tradition of fasting, and every summer hundreds and thousands of air nomads go on pilgrimage to this island, where Monk Tang Xu fasted for 98 days.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_401;Here, I think I'll find fellow travellers to the Southern Air Temple.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_402_whaletail_temple;Whaletail Temple;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_402_whaletail_temple;Hidden in the misty hills, a giant wooden temple was visible.\nA tall pagoda towered over the mist, indicating to skybison the location of the temple. Near the temple there were hundreds of living quarters on stilts. Skybison slept beneath them. There was a smell of incense everywhere, the fog held the smell in the air for many hours.\nThe temple seemed to be divided into two parts, connected by high bridges.\nAnd like the temple, there seemed to be two types of people.\nSome in the typical yellow-orange outfits of air nomads, and others completely in dark red, they stayed away from each other.\nThere was a vast market square around the pagoda, where nomads from all over the world exchanged goods. And although it was difficult to measure because of the fog, it seemed that this is the most densely populated place of airnomads in the world...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_402;Very impressive...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_new_avatar_journey_402_go_to_market_square;I'll take a walk down to the market square;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_403_whaletail_market;Whaletail Market;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_403_whaletail_market;Here, they traded goods from all over the world. Famous fruit pies, whale and walrus bones, silk, paintings, oil, paper, scrolls and books. Moreover, coins of all four nations were used in the exchange. Currency exchange shops were especially successful. Natural exchange was also often used.\nIt turned out that many air nomads traded here on behalf of the Beifong house. Here was the postal center of air nomads, from ancient times, the Earth Kings hired them as messengers.\nNo one could imagine that without air nomads, the world trade would end...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_403;It's very easy to get lost here;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_404_welcome_to_whaletail;Welcome to Whaletail;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_404_welcome_to_whaletail;I was as if intoxicated by this hazy picture. Suddenly, a monk patted me on the shoulder. It was a young monk, a messenger from the Temple. They were notified of my arrival and took a long time to find me...\nOn the way to the temple the messenger often stopped and showed me the sights around the temple. Great cave vaporium, jade statue of Tang Xu, spring and autumn fasting square. At the entrance to the western part of the temple, decapitated statues were visible at the entrance to the eastern part. We were warmly welcomed at the temple by a group of five elders, and the messenger left. We talked about the duties of an Avatar and my training.\nI was offered to stay for a couple of days to see the Tang Xu Festival, but wouldn't it be better to fly to the Southern Air Temple as soon as possible?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_404_stay_for_festival;Yes, I will stay for the festival;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_405_tang_xu_fast;Tang Xu Fast;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_405_tang_xu_fast;The Tang Xu Festival was much different from anything I could have imagined. Usually at festivals there is a lot of food, sound and activity. But here you were able to listen only gong banging and eat lean food.\nMany people still were playing pai-sho. And a lot were seating around the pagoda meditating.\nOne monk called me to his pai-sho table, offered to play. "You're not from here, right?"\n"I also see that you are not an airbender. Or is it no longer customary in the 'free' commune to shave your head?"\nThe game went on while I was telling him my story.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_406_whaletail_customs;Whaletail Customs;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_406_whaletail_customs;"Long ago, when airbenders flew not on skybison and gliders, but walked on the clouds, when our nation was young and proud, and the first statue of Wang had not yet been carved, there were those who did not hesitate to encroach on someone else's life. They worshiped hungry spirits in exchange for knowledge.\nMillennia later, after a long wandering in the spirit world, Guru Liu Xi recorded the history of air nomads. Guru Laghima, Shoken, and Liu Xi's historical notes have inspired a new generation of "free" folks, and the monk Tang Xu, without knowing it, found them a shelter here.\nThey eat meat and fish for Giant Koi for lamp oil. Our temple is divided into two parts, and the bridge between them will soon rot, which no one will notice. There are rumours of screams on the night of the Tang Xu festival, you won't be staying the night, are you?";;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_407_whaletail_customs_night;In the middle of the night, something interrupted my sleep. After the monk's story, I already had a restless dream.\nThe wind could be heard blowing through the wooden walls.\nBut all this was drowned out by the sound of the banging on a gong. The sound pulsed in my ears, although it was relaxing, and seemed to move away.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_408_fog_over_whaletail;The Fog over Whaletail;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_408_fog_over_whaletail;I quickly and quietly dressed, left the house standing on the pillars. Hazy skies in the distance was painted red and yellow glow. The smell of incense was emitted in the same direction. The light shone in the direction of the "Free" commune. The streets were empty, was I the only one who was awakened by this?Coming closer, the gong began to complement the sonorous voices of prayers in a strange language. Not understanding the words, one could feel their antiquity, that these words were definitely not from this era.\nFollowing the sound, I went out to the square near the eastern part of the temple. Hundreds of monks in red robes sat and with closed eyes recited the mantra melodiously.\n"Would you like to join, wanderer?" said the same monk I spoke to during the day. "Soon the time of sacrifice will come, and whose voices He does not hear, He will take with Him.";;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_409_spirit_of_mist;I don't know why, but I froze. I heard, through the prayers and the gong, the monk was saying something, his lips were moving, but I heard only This. As through the fog, as through the water, something was moving. I just noticed that the monk was talking with his eyes closed. Suddenly, he gave up his attempts, and sat down in his place, repeating the words of the ancients.\nThe sound of movement grew more and more, and a flying fish swam out of the forest. I felt a look on me, heavy and light at the same time.\nWhat am I doing here? What should I do? Is it a spirit? What kind of sacrifice? So many thoughts were running through my head. And something unlimited seemed to take control over me, something so familiar that it didn't take words to describe it. This was the first Avatar State.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Suddenly, the monks lost hundreds of years ago came out of the fog, the monks sitting in shock came to their senses and helped their people get out of the forest. The fog began to dissipate, rise and collect in large clouds. Soon the clouds flew away in an unknown direction.\nEven if the spirit is not destroyed, it will not soon disturb these places again.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_4090_penance;I really want to sleep...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_4091_murdered_by_whaletail_spirit;Hundreds of Avatars have seen this spirit before me. I feel their anger. Spirit feels it too. The fog is thickening, there is pitch darkness.\nA strong blow, possibly a tail. Dozens of broken tree branches behind. With high speed, it is behind the trunk.\nHit.\nI can't feel the body. Forces go somewhere. The light goes out. Where are you going? Why are you leaving me at the most important moment?\nHit.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_410_towards_the_wind;Towards the wind;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_410_towards_the_wind;Today we fly to the Southern Air Temple. We packed in a bison saddle, and I took one last look at the foggy hills of Whaletail Island. [fellow_traveler.GetFirstName] took the reins, and said yip-yip. His skybison [GetSkybisonName] kicked off the ground with its tail and we soared into the air. Very quickly we emerged from the blinding vapors, turns out they were not just fogs bug fallen clouds.\nFog look so soft from here, like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft, cottony heap. There where the clouds dropped to the ground, and seemed like fogs, I missed the Sun so much. Signal tower and lighthouses sweep below, soon the blue of the sea began to be seen, and I calmed down. The waters were calm too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_410;To Southern Air Temple!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_411_southern_air_temple;Southern Air Temple;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_411_southern_air_temple;We have crossed the Patola ridges and should be arriving at the Southern Air Temple soon.\nMountain peaks began to cut through the clouds, and in the distance could be seen the Great Temple, the Southern Air Temple.\nYoung monks were flying around, some of them playing air polo;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_411;The Greatest Temple...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_412_landing;Landing;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_412_landing;[fellow_traveler.GetFirstName] began to lead the bison to land.\nAs soon as we descended, five elders approached the bison. They bowed and the central one said: "It is a great honour for us to welcome you. We are the elders of this temple.\nWe and our best teachers will teach you airbending and our traditions."\nThen they escorted me to my monastery cell.\nAfter a long flight, I was very tired and fell asleep quickly;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_412;Zzz...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_413_gyatso;Gyatso;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_413_gyatso;I lived in the same room with several other monks. Gyatso was the most powerful airbender among us. We quickly hit it off. Gyatso was younger than me, but definitely wiser than many in the Fire Nation. Like other airbenders, he was not deprived of a sense of humor. For the first time since my separation from Sozin, I stopped feeling lonely.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_413;It's nice to have a friend;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_414_walking_around_the_temple;Walking around the temple;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_414_walking_around_the_temple;Gyatso was assigned as my guide and told to give me a tour of the Temple. I was shown dozens of prayer rooms and gardens. There is no large-scale production here and it is not customary to wear luxury.\nIt turned out that huge networks of underground corridors were dug under the Temple.\nThere they extract special blue crystals that are ground into dust and applied under the skin when tattooing.\nFinally, we went to the main tower. There is a sanctuary there, only the elders and the Avatar can enter. Massive wooden gates with a complex system of pipes can only be opened by airbending masters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_414;I'll open them soon;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_415_meditation;Meditation;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_415_meditation;Today we have been meditating all day. The monks say that air is the element of freedom. So the first step to understanding it is to free your mind. We sat in a circle and concentrated on our breathing. The aim of the exercise was to become aware of the most basic thing in the airbending - the process of breathing, to feel how air inhales, spreads over the body, and exhales freely.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_415;I've learned a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_416_balance;Balance;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_416_balance;Before conquering the air, I need to feel the balance. Today we practised balance on high and thin poles all day. I fell down many times, but the teachers helped me again and again. Many airbenders did not have much difficulty, many were meditating;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_416;Honestly, my feet are aching;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_417_airbending_gates;Airbending Gates;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_417_airbending_gates;After weeks of meditation and balance training, my next challenge will be walking through dozens of spinning gates. The monks say that the secret of this exercise is to liken oneself to a leaf in the wind. It teaches circular movements and overcoming obstacles without the use of force.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_417;It's painful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_418_airbending_gates_success;Airbending Gates: Success;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_418_airbending_gates_success;After many weeks of training, I finally passed the test. It was difficult, but now I am free to get through the gates at any speed. It's like a dance, not without a reason airbenders are so good at dancing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_418;What now?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_419_airbending_gates_fail;Airbending Gates: Fail;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_419_airbending_gates_fail;I haven't been able to get through this gate for weeks. I can't even make it a third of the way through, I keep getting hit and thrown out every time. The monks are reassuring, they say it's a difficult exercise and not all avatars pass it quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_419;Once again!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_420_air_gliding;Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_420_air_gliding;It was the first time I had airbended! After months of training, I'm finally flying through the clouds. The group and I were transported to the highest peak, from where I was told to take off in a glider. I thought it was crazy and I couldn't handle it, and I refused for a long time, but the teachers insisted that if anything happened, they would rescue me. Only when I got off the ground did I finally feel real freedom, and the air obeyed me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_420;I am an airbender now!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_421_the_avatar_sanctuary;The sanctuary;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_421_the_avatar_sanctuary;At last I can open the gate to the sanctuary. The monks say that only elders and avatars can open them. Opening them with an airbending, I entered the dark room. Walking a little further, I saw statues of past avatars: Kyoshi, Kuruk, Jangchen, Szeto, Salai... I don't know how, but just looking at them fills me with wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_421;Hopefully we'll talk soon;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_new_avatar_journey_425_airbending_mastering;Leaving Southern Air Temple;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_new_avatar_journey_425_airbending_mastering;I had finished mastering airbending. The monks blessed me and provided me with a sky bison escort to the water tribes. I'm going to miss this temple...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_425;Bye;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_new_avatar_journey_425_bye_gyatso;Bye, Gyatso!;;;;;;;;;;;x
