omashuan_delivery_1_desc;The Omashu delivery system is a complex system of chutes that are used to transport mail and packages throughout the city. The system consists of a series of slides and chutes through which various parcels travel in order to arrive at a certain destination. Earthbending sends the packages up the slides, while gravity moves them down. The slides are outfitted with numerous loading points, which also operate through earthbending.;;;;;;;;;;;x
