EVTNAME_ATLA_RIP_10001;Comet's Wake;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_10001;Months since the Comet shot through the skies, the wind has carried the ashes of everything destroyed by the Fire Nation's ruthless campaign of destruction. Dark clouds have blanketed some corners of the earth, bringing famine. Now, reports are coming in of a sickness spreading amongst those exposed to the ash. Clearly, a crisis is developing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4501;Our factories are home to many dedicated craftsmen as well as military engineers, and one such man as caught his superior's attention as a highly talented engineer. Perhaps his talents could better serve us directly?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4501;Yes, he could be of use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4501;We have no need of some overqualified worker.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4504;We'll compensate them and put an end to this waste problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4504;Bah, the factory is worth more than a few thousand peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4505;After rejecting a petition to clean up our factories sometime ago, landowners have taken to sabotaging our factories in the [hospital_location.GetName] province. Advisors are split whether we should fix the problem or whether we should crush this act of rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4505;We'll put an end to this issue then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4505;Send in the army and put these rebels down!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4520;Recently, at our factory in the [hospital_location.GetName] province, a chemical vat as exploded, seriously injuring numerous workers and shutting down the plant. It will take some cost to repair, but workers are clamouring for compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
