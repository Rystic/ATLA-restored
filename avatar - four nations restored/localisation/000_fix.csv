EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_10001;Months since the Comet shot through the skies, the wind has carried the ashes of everything destroyed by the Fire Nation's ruthless campaign of destruction. Dark clouds have blanketed some corners of the earth, bringing famine. Now, reports are coming in of a sickness spreading amongst those exposed to the ash. Clearly, a crisis is developing.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4501;Our factories are home to many dedicated craftsmen as well as military engineers, and one such man as caught his superior's attention as a highly talented engineer. Perhaps his talents could better serve us directly?;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4501;Yes, he could be of use.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4501;We have no need of some overqualified worker.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4514;The Agricultural Plant we built has allowed us to amass a considerable stockpile of preserved foodstuffs. As harvests turn poor however, many in the province starve. Our advisors are wondering if we should distribute some of the stockpile to ease the burden.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4514;Of course we will.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4514;Of course we will, for a price.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4512;A report is coming in that workers for our factory in the [hospital_location.GetName] province are protesting for better conditions after too many of their fellow workers have become maimed or killed by machinery incidents.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4512;We'll make sure the factory is made safer.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4512;Send the troops in to put them back to work!;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4504;Recently, villages have begun to loudly protest the presence of a factory in their province, [hospital_location.GetName]. They are saying that the waste from the factory has ruined their water and poisoned their land.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ATLA_RIP_4504;We'll compensate them and put an end to this waste problem.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ATLA_RIP_4504;Bah, the factory is worth more than a few thousand peasants.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ATLA_RIP_4505;After rejecting a petition to clean up our factories sometime ago, landowners have taken to sabotaging our factories in the [hospital_location.GetName] province.

ATLADESC.9006;After many years of toil, our colonists have made the [From.GetName] province their home.

ATLADESC.9007;We have destroyed our enemy's colony in [From.GetName] province, putting an end to their efforts to seize that land.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
