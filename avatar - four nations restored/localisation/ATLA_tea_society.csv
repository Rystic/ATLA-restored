# PLANTATION EVENTS
tea_build_plantation_1_start;Your time with the Tea Enthusiasts has been inspirational, and over the last few weeks, you've been mulling the idea of growing a tea-leaf garden of your own. Others have done it, so why not you? Mind abuzz with thoughts of hosting tea parties with homegrown blends, you start considering the cost of such an endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_1;Gardening books! New tools! Fertilisers! Every coin is worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_2;I can get started on a modest budget.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_3;How hard can it be to buy some seeds and water some plants?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_fail;Unfortunately, the tea bushes you planted did not take. Perhaps gardening is not your strong suite.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_fail_option;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_finish;It may have started slow, but your tea garden is finally bearing fruit -- or rather, leaves. In celebration, you decide to christen your harvest by inviting over your friends for tea, in what will surely be the first of many such parties.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_finish_option;Drink up, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start;You've spent quite a lot of time enjoying the tea-leaf garden you inherited, both in harvesting leaves, and handing out packets of seeds to friends who adore your tea. Lately, though, you can't help but feel the garden is a bit... small. Your ancestor was a master caretaker, and the bushes they planted are well bred... but everything is so confined! Surely, by spreading such strong seeds to nearby land, your estate will flourish with tea bushes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_gold;I'll hire some gardeners to make sure the new bushes are tended.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_self;Time to get my hands dirty!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_spirits;Perhaps I should add some sacred soil from the forest?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_free;Let me just throw around some seeds, and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_bail;On second thought, the garden is a fine size.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_fail;After several years of waiting, the tea bushes you cast seeds for never took root. Perhaps your ancestor knew better, and that's why they stuck with such a small garden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_fail_option;At least I still have the garden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish;Several years ago, you planted tea seeds around your land, hoping to expand a single garden to a near-jungle of tea leaves. Peaking out your window, you now overlook a resplendent grove, bustling with bushes, dotted with all sorts of hybrids growing among them. Truly, there is nowhere on your estate you can go where a tea bush isn't within reach.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_self;I think I'm getting the hang of this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_spirits;What strange leaves! I wonder what the tea will taste like?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1;Some time ago, your family planted a tea-leaf garden on the estate, and after allowing those bushes to expand into the surrounding nature, ended up with a vibrant grove entangled everything nearby. Of course, this gift was part of your inheritance -- after so many generations of caretakers, the responsibility finally falls on you to maintain it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1_option;Perhaps there is more I can do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_2;Surveying the untamed wilds of leaves and vines, you begin to think of how else you might manage such a grove. Why stop at just tending and pruning? With a little organisation, this grove could be developed into a real farm, with a set harvest, and a knowledgeable staff overseeing it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_1;Find me the best farmers in the land, and I will pay handsomely!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_self;I will plead my case to the townsfolk to help!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_spirits;I will seek guidance from the Spirits, to form a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_2;I can pay some farmers modestly to handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_bail;This will be too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish;You wipe the sweat from your brow as you head in, satisfied after a hard day's work in the field. What was once untamed and erratic is now a meticulously organised farm, with rows of bushes, and even set ground for crossbreeding new tea leaves. It wasn't easy, but because of your efforts, you were able to reign in the grove you were handed-down, and make the harvest even more bountiful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_self;Just an honest day's work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_spirits;Thank the Spirits for blessing my estate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_fail;Once again looking out upon your estate, you see your efforts to tame the wilds have been largely frivolous. You tried your best, but perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_fail_option;Oh well, I can still enjoy the grove.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1;Your family's tea farm has become quite famous, boasting not only generations of caretakers, but generations of patrons. However, that popularity ends at your borders -- truthfully, as well tended as the farms are, their tea production simply isn't high enough to meet the demand outside your own lands. Puzzling over this problem, you lock yourself in your study.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1_option;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_2;Labouring into the night, you draw up plans for a grand plantation -- not just one, but tens or perhaps even hundreds of well-tended farms. You will drive production so high that every tea shop across the Four Nations will stock your familial blends. Such an endeavour will be massive, and thus your plan will have to be meticulous.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_1;No cost is too great.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_self;This will be our glory! This will be the plantation of the people!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_spirits;I have sought the Spirits before, I shall do so again!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_2;If I'm careful, I can do this on a budget.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_bail;I need more time to gather resources.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_finish;After almost a decade of labour, your grand vision has been realised: from a humble garden, to a blossoming grove, to a well-kept farm, and now finally to this, a colossal plantation, the absolute apex of a generational love of tea and the desire to spread that passion. Perusing the newly-leafed fields, you think back to all the work your forefathers put in before you, and how all of this must have started with a single inspirational thought after a warm cup of tea. You also think forward, to your children, and their children, and all your descendants, who will always have this plantation as part of their lives, and will feel you and your ancestors love through it. What you've built here isn't just a handful of farms, it's a monument to your whole family, past and future, and by the Spirits, it is glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_finish_option;It is magnificent!;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_fail;It would seem that starting a tea plantation is much more difficult then it seems. Although there's no recouping the money you've sunk into this, you feel like any more investments would just be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_fail_option;The farm is enough, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;x

# PLANTATION EVENTS
tea_build_plantation_1_start;Your time with the Tea Enthusiasts has been inspirational, and over the last few weeks, you've been mulling the idea of growing a tea-leaf garden of your own. Others have done it, so why not you? Mind abuzz with thoughts of hosting tea parties with homegrown blends, you start considering the cost of such an endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_1;Gardening books! New tools! Fertilisers! Every coin is worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_2;I can get started on a modest budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_start_option_gold_3;How hard can it be to buy some seeds and water some plants?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_fail;Unfortunately, the tea bushes you planted did not take. Perhaps gardening is not your strong suite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_fail_option;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_finish;It may have started slow, but your tea garden is finally bearing fruit -- or rather, leaves. In celebration, you decide to christen your harvest by inviting over your friends for tea, in what will surely be the first of many such parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_1_finish_option;Drink up, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start;You've spent quite a lot of time enjoying the tea-leaf garden you inherited, both in harvesting leaves, and handing out packets of seeds to friends who adore your tea. Lately, though, you can't help but feel the garden is a bit... small. Your ancestor was a master caretaker, and the bushes they planted are well bred... but everything is so confined! Surely, by spreading such strong seeds to nearby land, your estate will flourish with tea bushes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_gold;I'll hire some gardeners to make sure the new bushes are tended.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_self;Time to get my hands dirty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_spirits;Perhaps I should add some sacred soil from the forest?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_free;Let me just throw around some seeds, and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_start_option_bail;On second thought, the garden is a fine size.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_fail;After several years of waiting, the tea bushes you cast seeds for never took root. Perhaps your ancestor knew better, and that's why they stuck with such a small garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_fail_option;At least I still have the garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish;Several years ago, you planted tea seeds around your land, hoping to expand a single garden to a near-jungle of tea leaves. Peaking out your window, you now overlook a resplendent grove, bustling with bushes, dotted with all sorts of hybrids growing among them. Truly, there is nowhere on your estate you can go where a tea bush isn't within reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_self;I think I'm getting the hang of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_2_finish_option_spirits;What strange leaves! I wonder what the tea will taste like?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1;Some time ago, your family planted a tea-leaf garden on the estate, and after allowing those bushes to expand into the surrounding nature, ended up with a vibrant grove entangled everything nearby. Of course, this gift was part of your inheritance -- after so many generations of caretakers, the responsibility finally falls on you to maintain it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_1_option;Perhaps there is more I can do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_2;Surveying the untamed wilds of leaves and vines, you begin to think of how else you might manage such a grove. Why stop at just tending and pruning? With a little organisation, this grove could be developed into a real farm, with a set harvest, and a knowledgeable staff overseeing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_1;Find me the best farmers in the land, and I will pay handsomely!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_self;I will plead my case to the townsfolk to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_spirits;I will seek guidance from the Spirits, to form a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_gold_2;I can pay some farmers modestly to handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_start_option_bail;This will be too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish;You wipe the sweat from your brow as you head in, satisfied after a hard day's work in the field. What was once untamed and erratic is now a meticulously organised farm, with rows of bushes, and even set ground for crossbreeding new tea leaves. It wasn't easy, but because of your efforts, you were able to reign in the grove you were handed-down, and make the harvest even more bountiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_self;Just an honest day's work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_finish_option_spirits;Thank the Spirits for blessing my estate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_fail;Once again looking out upon your estate, you see your efforts to tame the wilds have been largely frivolous. You tried your best, but perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_3_fail_option;Oh well, I can still enjoy the grove.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1;Your family's tea farm has become quite famous, boasting not only generations of caretakers, but generations of patrons. However, that popularity ends at your borders -- truthfully, as well tended as the farms are, their tea production simply isn't high enough to meet the demand outside your own lands. Puzzling over this problem, you lock yourself in your study.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_1_option;Hmm..;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_2;Labouring into the night, you draw up plans for a grand plantation -- not just one, but tens or perhaps even hundreds of well-tended farms. You will drive production so high that every tea shop across the Four Nations will stock your familial blends. Such an endeavour will be massive, and thus your plan will have to be meticulous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_1;No cost is too great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_self;This will be our glory! This will be the plantation of the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_spirits;I have sought the Spirits before, I shall do so again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_gold_2;If I'm careful, I can do this on a budget.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_start_option_bail;I need more time to gather resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_finish;After almost a decade of labour, your grand vision has been realised: from a humble garden, to a blossoming grove, to a well-kept farm, and now finally to this, a colossal plantation, the absolute apex of a generational love of tea and the desire to spread that passion. Perusing the newly-leafed fields, you think back to all the work your forefathers put in before you, and how all of this must have started with a single inspirational thought after a warm cup of tea. You also think forward, to your children, and their children, and all your descendants, who will always have this plantation as part of their lives, and will feel you and your ancestors love through it. What you've built here isn't just a handful of farms, it's a monument to your whole family, past and future, and by the Spirits, it is glorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_finish_option;It is magnificent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_fail;It would seem that starting a tea plantation is much more difficult then it seems. Although there's no recouping the money you've sunk into this, you feel like any more investments would just be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_build_plantation_4_fail_option;The farm is enough, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It turns out to be one of your acquaintances, dressed in formal attire, looking puzzled at the empty room. "They said that you were hosting a tea party. Well, I brought biscuits!".

The two of you sit for a few hours, gossiping about all sorts of happenings, and in that time you explain you're planning to host a party, so he wasn't entirely wrong. "That sounds marvelous! In that case, here, take some biscuits. They'll be an excellent snack.";;;;;;;;;;;x

find_physician_desc;You remember, when you were much younger, that your family physician was very fond of tea, and was never without a fresh cup.

Sitting at the table, she hands you a cup, and says "Here, a special herbal tea made from homegrown ginger root".;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_bad;Ah, it was herbal tea!;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_medium;Ma'am, would I be able to borrow some of your special ginger root?;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_good;I'm planning a grand tea party, and would love some of your ginger root!;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_bad_desc;"Yes, I always loved herbal tea. The root for it is cultivated right here". She gestures to a windowsill garden, with fat ginger-leaves spilling over the side. Although plentiful, you struggle to find the words to ask this old lady if you can have some. In the end, you part ways, going home empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_medium_desc;"Oh, certainly", she says, reaching into a planter and pulling out a fresh sample. "Here it is. Be gentle when you brew it. If the water is too hot, or you oversaturate the kettle, you'll end up with a bitter mess!". You laugh, and promise to be careful when you blend the tea yourself. The two of you catch up, and after a short amount of time, you decide to head home, quarry in-hand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_good_desc;"For you dear, of course. Here, take a jar of it. It's good for the heart. You won't find tea like this anywhere else!".

guest_brings_date_start_event;Busy in the kitchen, you're interrupted by one of your guests beckoning you to your tea room. "Quick! Quick! Come see this!", he says in a frenzy, as you follow at a hurried pace. When you arrive, you see your good friend, Mushie, a man well into his seventies, with his arm over the shoulder of a girl no older than twenty-five! "There you are!", he says proudly, "I'd like you to meet Lai Ti".;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_start_option_low_diplomacy;Mushie, you lucky dog!;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_start_option_low_diplomacy_tooltip;You congratulate Mushie on dating a girl far younger than he is.;;;;;;;;;;;x

guest_brings_date_start_option_low_learning_tooltip;You accuse Mushie of dating a girl far younger than he is.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_start_option_high_diplomacy;Mushie, who is this lovely young lady?;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_start_option_high_diplomacy_tooltip;You ask Mushie about the girl, getting the facts before making a judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_start_option_high_learning;Ah, I can see the family resemblance!;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_start_option_high_learning_tooltip;You recognise quite quickly that this woman is related to Mushie.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_event;Mushie gives you an angry look. "Lai Ti is my granddaughter, not my date. For the Spirits' sake, I'm almost fifty years older than her!". The poor girl looks off to the side, embarrassed by your comment, and she and Mushie storm off. You look at your friend who dragged you from the kitchen, and he shrugs and says "Anyone could have made that mistake!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_option;What an embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_option_tooltip;Your idiot friend is at fault!;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_learning_event;Mushie is taken aback by your statement, and after a moment of uncomfortable silence, he introduces you to the girl who is, in fact, his granddaughter. Not knowing what to say, you stumble for words, and decide to simply avoid Mushie for the rest of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_learning_option;This is awkward.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_learning_option_tooltip;It really is.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_diplomacy_event;Pleased at your response, Mushie smiles and says "Yes, this is Lai Ti, my granddaughter! She is a bit of an up-and-coming tea enthusiast herself, and when I told her about this party, she jumped at the chance to come!". The girl looks at you and gives a small curtsy. "Thank you for having us", she says, "you are a most gracious host!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_diplomacy_option;You and Mushie are welcome any time!;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_diplomacy_option_tooltip;Your silver-tongue saved you from a disasterous misunderstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_learning_event;"You've got a sharp eye!", Mushie says, "Lai Ti is my granddaugther". The three of you exchange pleasantries, and during that time, your friend who dragged you from the kitchen slinks away in shame. When you catch up with him later, he seems embarrassed at his mistake. "I thought those two were...!", but you stop him. You know exactly what he thought.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_learning_option;This is why you mustn't jump to conclusions!;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_learning_option_tooltip;Your wits helped you avoid an awkward situation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_snack_event;Humbling and bumbling through your house, getting guests their first few cups of tea, you hear a knock at the door. A late arrival, you presume.

no_snacks_served_event;"Do you have any food? Any morsel I can snack on?", one of your guests asks. "Surely, there's something in the kitchen I can have, I missed lunch and I'm quite starving". You offer the man the what you've got on hand, but you note to yourself that next time, you should probably lay out some food for your hungry guests.;;;;;;;;;;;x
no_snacks_served_option;I should have picked up something...;;;;;;;;;;;x
multiple_snacks_served_event;Somehow, your simple tea party has become a banquet. There are so many snacks, truly your guests have a veritable cornucopia of which to choose.;;;;;;;;;;;x
multiple_snacks_served_option;I am a supreme host!;;;;;;;;;;;x
berries_served_event;Laying a large platter on the table, your guests marvel at the assortment of cooked berries and dried fruits before them. "Picked them myself, while I was out gathering leaves", you say triumphantly. No sooner do you lay it out than you see fingers greedily digging through the pile, looking for the largest and juiciest among the berries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
berries_served_option_normal;I better get some napkins...;;;;;;;;;;;x
berries_served_option_white_dragon;Goes well with the White Dragon Tea, if I do say so myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
biscuits_served_event;You eyes light up when you open your front door and see who's come to join the party. "Did I get the right day this time?", the man says, looking happy to see people stirring behind you. "Ahh, you've put out the biscuits! I brought a few more, just in case!". Shoving his way inside, he moves over to the table, and adds his new biscuits to the batch.;;;;;;;;;;;x
biscuits_served_option_normal;Glad you could make it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
biscuits_served_option_ginger_root;Oh, the sweetness will offset the ginger root!;;;;;;;;;;;x
fire_flakes_served_event;Taking the huge wicker basket, you lay out several plates on a table off to the side, and let your party know that food has been served. Like a swarm of hungry cat-locusts, your guests descend on the Fire Flakes, and after almost no time, you find the basket has been picked clean.;;;;;;;;;;;x
fire_flakes_served_option_normal;My considerate friend saved me from such embarrassment!;;;;;;;;;;;x

green_tea_served_event;Regaling your expedition into the woods to your guests, you begin pouring out cups of freshly brewed green tea. "No farms, no special cultivation, just the product of nature's blessing", you boast. As your guests wait for their brews to cool, they begin swapping tales of venturing out into the forest themselves, and all the strange things they encountered therein.;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_option;Drink up, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of green tea, and...;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_bad_event;Although picked fresh, natural doesn't always mean 'the best', and this green tea is far, far too bitter for your liking. You can see your guests recoiling to the taste as well, but finishing anyway, to not be rude.;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_medium_event;Finishing your first cup, you find the green tea delightful. It's not much different than what you'd find in a shop, but it's more satisfying since you picked the leaves yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_good_event;You barely make it half way through your first cup before you see one of your guests reach for the kettle. "This is the best green tea I've ever had in my life! You must show me where you picked these leaves!". You give a satisfied grin, and promise to take him on your next exploration.;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_event;"Esteemed guests, today I have a very special treat for you! While exploring the forest, I came across a rare White Dragon tea bush. Picking its leaves, I have prepared a most delicious brew!". You hear a few small claps and gasps as an air of excitement fills the room. Grabbing the freshly brewed pot, you lean in and pour the first cup for a guest. Not hesistating a moment, he takes a sip, and...;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_option;......;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_option_tooltip;You brace for your guest's reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_event;Disaster! The White Dragon leaves you picked were actually White Jade leaves! Your guest kneels over, covered in disgusting red blisters! He needs emergency help!;;;;;;;;;;;x

white_dragon_tea_served_bad_bad_followup_option_tooltip;I've brought disgrace to this household!;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_event;Not hesitating for a moment, you grab Bacui berries, and feed them to your suffering friend. Within minutes, the rashes go down, and you see him begin to return to normal. However, your other guests still seem quite displeased at your near-fatal mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_option;This could have been a nightmare.;;;;;;;;;;;x

jasmine_tea_served_event;"So for today, I decided to go with something classic. Something sweet. That's why I've brewed this fine jasmine tea for us to share". Your guests look at you pleased, taking comfort in the familiarity of the flavor. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the best way to go about.;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_option;I hope everyone is thirsty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of jasmine tea, and...;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_bad_event;Taking a sip of the tea, you're met with an overwhelming sweetness, ruining the overall flavor. Perhaps the jasmine blossoms you used were no good?;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_medium_event;The jasmine tea is as fine as any other, and as you pour cup after cup, you can hear the satisfied sips of your guests. Perhaps what everyone really needed was this -- a relaxing afternoon, with a well-loved blend.;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_good_event;There's an art to brewing tea, and a balance in maintaining the flavor of the drink itself with the added sweetness of the jasmine blossoms. Knowing that, the brew you made today is nothing short of masterful -- an absolutely perfect blend of flavors. Despite being such a familiar tea, you feel refreshed after each sip, and feel proud on how something so common could be made so beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_with_special_guest_event;"Recently, I visited a very special family friend of mine, and found out, like me, she was a lover of tea. She generously gave me a sample of ginger root from her own garden, which I've used for today's brew." You gesture to the back of the room, "So everyone, please, say thank you to the woman who made today possible!". Everyone turns and softly claps, and you see your physician begin to blush.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_without_special_guest_event;"Recently, I visited a very special family friend of mine, and found out, like me, she was a lover of tea. She generously gave me a sample of ginger root from her own garden, which I've used for today's brew." You think of the woman sitting in her home, and part of you wishes she could be here to receive the praise she so rightly deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_option;Good for the heart, and the soul!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of green tea, and...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_bad_event;It only occurs to you now that how intensely bitter this ginger tea is. Thinking back, you never asked for the actual recipe your physician used, just for the ginger root itself. Even your guests, trying to be polite, can't help but wince with each sip.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_medium_event;Although you wouldn't call it flavorless, it's clear that the ginger tea you have is medicinal. Still, your guests don't seem to mind -- most of them are elderly, and they can appreciate a blend good for the heart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_good_event;What a unique flavor! Part of you believed the tea would be intensely bitter, but it is somehow bitter and... sweet? Whatever your physician gave you, it is her own creation, and you truly cannot think of another tea like this one. Your guests seem baffled, too, as you hear chatter flare up trying to solve the mysteries behind this wonderful blend.;;;;;;;;;;;x
# post-tea evaluation
post_tea_bad_event;Instead of lively chat, your party is mostly murmurs. Your guests don't seem to have much to talk about, and are only taking small sips of the tea you've laid out for them. Perhaps the ingredients weren't as good as you hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_bad_option;Maybe they're just lost in thought?;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_bad_option_tooltip;For a party, it's unusually quiet...;;;;;;;;;;;x

hot_spring_water_tea_event;One of your colleagues pulls you aside, to privately ask you a question. "I hate to be a bother, but what did you put in this tea? Aches and pains I've grown to know have vanished, and my knees feel like they did twenty years ago!". You smile wryly, knowing full well the hot spring water has worked its magic.;;;;;;;;;;;x

doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_event;"One of the oldest in our tribe, in fact!", she says, not missing a beat. The ginger root continues to swirl, making beautiful patterns, before pouring itself across several cups.;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_normal_option;A healer, and a teabender, at my party!;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_normal_option_tooltip;You're grateful your party has been attended by such a prestigious member of the tribe!;;;;;;;;;;;x

doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_teach_option_tooltip;You learn the basics of healing from your old physician.;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_event;"I wouldn't call myself a mystic. Most girls are raised to heal, and I just happened to pick up a few other techniques along the way". The floating tea makes a few more dazzling swirls before dropping suddenly to the table, filling the cups of all those watching. "Truly, I've always thought of myself as more of a... teabender".;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_option;Of course, the fifth element!;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_option_tooltip;Your party has been blessed with such skill and entertainment!;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_event;Your physician winks at you. "Yes, in my younger days I travelled the world, touring the Nations, and healing all those in need along the way. When I found my youth spent, I settled down, and became a simple family doctor." The tea in the air continues to swish and swirl, and finally lands to fill several cups. "A technique I've perfected over the years. Go on, try some!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_option;You're a teabender!;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_option_tooltip;She may only know one element, but what an element it is!;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_events;Strutting in from the kitchen, the Badger Spirit wanders into your tea room, to the surprise of your guests. Most seem to think it's just a pet, and some even scratch its head, of which it is oddly receptive. The weirdness only begins when the badger sits at your Pai Sho table, and abruptly lays out the pieces for a game.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_option;Who among you can defeat my trained badger?;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_option_tooltip;You're not sure where this is going, but you're interested to watch.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_option;I will play the badger myself!;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_option_tooltip;You'll probably be able to play it off as a joke, without anyone realising this is a spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_option;I'll play, but I must be wary of this spirit's knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_option_tooltip;Perhaps you can learn a thing or two from this creature?;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_event;"I'll take that bet!", one of your guests boasts. The room roars with laughter as he sets up his pieces, and the man joins in with them. However, after just a few moves, it is clear the badger is the superior player, and the man is easily defeated. "How? What? This badger?", he sputters in disbelief. "I... don't know how you've managed to train him, but this badger... is a beast!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_option;He, uh, learned from the best.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_option_tooltip;Your guests are impressed with your fictitious animal-handling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_event;Sitting down at the Pai Sho table, you place your pieces on the board. As the game unfolds, however, you realise the situation is helpless. The Badger Spirit is impossibly skilled, and seems to anticipate your every move. The match is over quickly, and your guests clap and laugh, thinking the entire thing was a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_option;I meant to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_option_tooltip;You lost, but at least you learned something.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_event;You sit down at the table, aware of what you're about to get into. Your guests laugh and clap, thinking this some elaborate joke, but you know better. Obviously there's no way to read your opponent, but it is a badger, but you can probably learn something from its moves. The game starts, and you realise quickly that this creature has perhaps centuries of Pai Sho knowledge under its furry pelt.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_option;It is impossible to win!;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_option_tooltip;The Spirit's moves are impossible to counter!;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_event;The game is over quickly, and the applause from your guests has only grown louder. To them, this whole thing was a show. But, gazing into your opponents beady eyes, you sense a real pride it has in victory. Smiling, you give a small clap, and congratulate the badger.;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_option;Well played, well played!;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_option_tooltip;You lost, but you walk away with a greater understanding of the game.;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_event;So many more guests showed up than you expected, and as day wanes, you begin to hear whispers among the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_tooltip;You listen to the whispers...;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_bad_option;Such nasty murmurs!;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_medium_option;It seems like a mixed bag...;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_good_option;Everyone is talking about what a great time they had!;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_high_diplomacy_option;I should mingle and meet some new people.;;;;;;;;;;;x

post_tea_pai_sho_badger_followup_event;Looking at each other nervously, the guests remark they feel too tired to play against such a... strange creature. Fortunately for them, the Badger Spirit seems to have vanished. Scouring the house for where it may have gone, you eventually happen upon a small bag hewn from badger fur, full of coins!;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_pai_sho_badger_followup_option;The badger has gifted me for my hospitality!;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_pai_sho_badger_followup_option_tooltip;You ponder the whimsical nature of the spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_play_instruments_event;With the main course served, you and your friends retire to your livingroom, for some delightful post-tea banter. Suddenly, you hear a soft-noise fill the room, and notice one of your fellow Tea Enthusiasts is gently playing a tsungi horn.

post_tea_guest_asleep_in_bed_extra_guests_followup_event;Prodding the man awake, you ask for his name, but he's apparently too drunk to answer. It looks like some of your guests were having more than just tea today!;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_guest_asleep_in_bed_extra_guests_followup_option;Shameful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_guest_asleep_in_bed_extra_guests_followup_option_tooltip;You think you'd have set a better example than that!;;;;;;;;;;;x

early_guest_start_desc;Milling about your home, you're surprised to hear a knock on the door. It turns out to be one of your acquaintances, dressed in formal attire, looking puzzled at the empty room. "They said that you were hosting a tea party. Well, I brought biscuits!". It seems as though this poor man is confused, and arrived far too early!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
early_guest_start_bad;I'm sorry, there's no party here today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
early_guest_start_good;Ah, of course, of course, but we're still in the planning phase!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

early_guest_no_party_good;My friend, you came this far out, let's share those biscuits over some tea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
early_guest_recovery_desc;"Oh, of course!", the man barges in, excited to see his trip wasn't in vein. The two of you sit for a few hours, gossiping about all sorts of happenings, and in that time you explain you're planning to host a party, so he wasn't entirely wrong. "That sounds marvelous! In that case, here, take some biscuits. They'll be an excellent snack.";;;;;;;;;;;x
early_guest_recovery_option;Thank you so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

early_guest_planning_biscuits;Actually, I need your help with snacks...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
early_guest_planning_leaves;Oh, Jasmine! That sounds delicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_desc;You remember, when you were much younger, that your family physician was very fond of tea, and was never without a fresh cup. Thinking back, you distinctly remember the aroma of what she drank, but can't put your finger on exactly what it was. Now that you're planning your own party, you think it might be good to visit her and ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_continue;She only lives a few blocks away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_ignore;I don't want to bother her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_market_desc;Not feeling like harassing an old lady about tea she had decades ago, you instead spend the day perusing the shops, hoping to find something you can use.;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_market_option;Maybe this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_desc;Knocking on her door, you see the wrinkly face of your old physician. Now retired, she spends her days tending plants and enjoying tea by herself. Happy to see you, she invites you in, and admits you're the first company she's had in a long time. Sitting at the table, she hands you a cup, and says "Here, a special herbal tea made from homegrown ginger root".;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_bad;Ah, it was herbal tea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_medium;Ma'am, would I be able to borrow some of your special ginger root?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_good;I'm planning a grand tea party, and would love some of your ginger root!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_bad_desc;"Yes, I always loved herbal tea. The root for it is cultivated right here". She gestures to a windowsill garden, with fat ginger-leaves spilling over the side. Although plentiful, you struggle to find the words to ask this old lady if you can have some. In the end, you part ways, going home empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_medium_desc;"Oh, certainly", she says, reaching into a planter and pulling out a fresh sample. "Here it is. Be gentle when you brew it. If the water is too hot, or you oversaturate the kettle, you'll end up with a bitter mess!". You laugh, and promise to be careful when you blend the tea yourself. The two of you catch up, and after a short amount of time, you decide to head home, quarry in-hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
find_physician_meeting_good_desc;"For you dear, of course. Here, take a jar of it. It's good for the heart. You won't find tea like this anywhere else!". Hastily, she shoves a rather large jar of dried roots into your hands. After spending another hour catching up, the two of you part ways, and you go home prize in-hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

special_visitor_badger_event;During a lull in arrivals, you decide to take a moment to step into your kitchen to check if your next kettle of hot water is ready.

guest_brings_date_start_event;Busy in the kitchen, you're interrupted by one of your guests beckoning you to your tea room. "Quick! Quick! Come see this!", he says in a frenzy, as you follow at a hurried pace. When you arrive, you see your good friend, Mushie, a man well into his seventies, with his arm over the shoulder of a girl no older than twenty-five! "There you are!", he says proudly, "I'd like you to meet Lai Ti".;;;;;;;;;;;x

guest_brings_date_start_option_high_learning;Ah, I can see the family resemblance!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_start_option_high_learning_tooltip;You recognise quite quickly that this woman is related to Mushie.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_event;Mushie gives you an angry look. "Lai Ti is my granddaughter, not my date. For the Spirits' sake, I'm almost fifty years older than her!". The poor girl looks off to the side, embarrassed by your comment, and she and Mushie storm off. You look at your friend who dragged you from the kitchen, and he shrugs and says "Anyone could have made that mistake!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_option;What an embarrassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_diplomacy_option_tooltip;Your idiot friend is at fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_learning_event;Mushie is taken aback by your statement, and after a moment of uncomfortable silence, he introduces you to the girl who is, in fact, his granddaughter. Not knowing what to say, you stumble for words, and decide to simply avoid Mushie for the rest of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_learning_option;This is awkward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_low_learning_option_tooltip;It really is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_diplomacy_event;Pleased at your response, Mushie smiles and says "Yes, this is Lai Ti, my granddaughter! She is a bit of an up-and-coming tea enthusiast herself, and when I told her about this party, she jumped at the chance to come!". The girl looks at you and gives a small curtsy. "Thank you for having us", she says, "you are a most gracious host!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_diplomacy_option;You and Mushie are welcome any time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_diplomacy_option_tooltip;Your silver-tongue saved you from a disasterous misunderstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_learning_event;"You've got a sharp eye!", Mushie says, "Lai Ti is my granddaugther". The three of you exchange pleasantries, and during that time, your friend who dragged you from the kitchen slinks away in shame. When you catch up with him later, he seems embarrassed at his mistake. "I thought those two were...!", but you stop him. You know exactly what he thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guest_brings_date_high_learning_option;This is why you mustn't jump to conclusions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

guest_brings_snack_event;Humbling and bumbling through your house, getting guests their first few cups of tea, you hear a knock at the door. A late arrival, you presume.

berries_served_event;Laying a large platter on the table, your guests marvel at the assortment of cooked berries and dried fruits before them.

berries_served_option_white_dragon;Goes well with the White Dragon Tea, if I do say so myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
biscuits_served_event;You eyes light up when you open your front door and see who's come to join the party. "Did I get the right day this time?", the man says, looking happy to see people stirring behind you. "Ahh, you've put out the biscuits! I brought a few more, just in case!". Shoving his way inside, he moves over to the table, and adds his new biscuits to the batch.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
biscuits_served_option_normal;Glad you could make it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
biscuits_served_option_ginger_root;Oh, the sweetness will offset the ginger root!;;;;;;;;;;;x
fire_flakes_served_event;Taking the huge wicker basket, you lay out several plates on a table off to the side, and let your party know that food has been served. Like a swarm of hungry cat-locusts, your guests descend on the Fire Flakes, and after almost no time, you find the basket has been picked clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fire_flakes_served_option_normal;My considerate friend saved me from such embarrassment!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# tea time
tea_time_announcement_event;You hear the steaming from your kettles in the kitchen. Tea time has begun!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_time_announcement_option;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_time_announcement_tooltip;Your guests wait with eager cups.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_bad_option;That could have been better...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_bad_option_tooltip;Your guests seem unimpressed with the tea...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_medium_option;Delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_medium_option_tooltip;Your guests are satisfied with the tea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_good_option;This is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tea_good_option_tooltip;Your guests love the tea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_event;Regaling your expedition into the woods to your guests, you begin pouring out cups of freshly brewed green tea. "No farms, no special cultivation, just the product of nature's blessing", you boast. As your guests wait for their brews to cool, they begin swapping tales of venturing out into the forest themselves, and all the strange things they encountered therein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_option;Drink up, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of green tea, and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_bad_event;Although picked fresh, natural doesn't always mean 'the best', and this green tea is far, far too bitter for your liking. You can see your guests recoiling to the taste as well, but finishing anyway, to not be rude.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_medium_event;Finishing your first cup, you find the green tea delightful. It's not much different than what you'd find in a shop, but it's more satisfying since you picked the leaves yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
green_tea_served_good_event;You barely make it half way through your first cup before you see one of your guests reach for the kettle. "This is the best green tea I've ever had in my life! You must show me where you picked these leaves!". You give a satisfied grin, and promise to take him on your next exploration.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_event;"Esteemed guests, today I have a very special treat for you! While exploring the forest, I came across a rare White Dragon tea bush. Picking its leaves, I have prepared a most delicious brew!". You hear a few small claps and gasps as an air of excitement fills the room. Grabbing the freshly brewed pot, you lean in and pour the first cup for a guest. Not hesistating a moment, he takes a sip, and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_option;......;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_option_tooltip;You brace for your guest's reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_event;Disaster! The White Dragon leaves you picked were actually White Jade leaves! Your guest kneels over, covered in disgusting red blisters! He needs emergency help!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_option_bad_bad;This party is over, we need to get him to the doctor!;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_option_bad_bad_tooltip;Chaos ensues!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_option_bad_good;The berries I picked! Quickly, give him some!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_option_bad_good_tooltip;You may be able to save him yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_bad_followup_event;With no way to help your friend, the other guests grab him and rush him out the door. Your party has ended in catastrophe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_bad_followup_option;This is a nightmare.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_bad_followup_option_tooltip;I've brought disgrace to this household!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_event;Not hesitating for a moment, you grab Bacui berries, and feed them to your suffering friend. Within minutes, the rashes go down, and you see him begin to return to normal. However, your other guests still seem quite displeased at your near-fatal mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_option;This could have been a nightmare.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_bad_good_followup_option_tooltip;You realise things could have been much worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_good_event;"Delicious! Absolutely delicious! Brewed to perfection!", he elates, a smile stretching across his face. "To think we'd get to sample such a rare tea, and so fresh! This is the best tea party I've ever attended!";;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_good_option;Thank you! Anything for my guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
white_dragon_tea_served_good_option_tooltip;You served a truly rare tea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_event;"So for today, I decided to go with something classic. Something sweet. That's why I've brewed this fine jasmine tea for us to share". Your guests look at you pleased, taking comfort in the familiarity of the flavor. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the best way to go about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_option;I hope everyone is thirsty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of jasmine tea, and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_bad_event;Taking a sip of the tea, you're met with an overwhelming sweetness, ruining the overall flavor. Perhaps the jasmine blossoms you used were no good?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_medium_event;The jasmine tea is as fine as any other, and as you pour cup after cup, you can hear the satisfied sips of your guests. Perhaps what everyone really needed was this -- a relaxing afternoon, with a well-loved blend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jasmine_tea_served_good_event;There's an art to brewing tea, and a balance in maintaining the flavor of the drink itself with the added sweetness of the jasmine blossoms. Knowing that, the brew you made today is nothing short of masterful -- an absolutely perfect blend of flavors. Despite being such a familiar tea, you feel refreshed after each sip, and feel proud on how something so common could be made so beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_with_special_guest_event;"Recently, I visited a very special family friend of mine, and found out, like me, she was a lover of tea. She generously gave me a sample of ginger root from her own garden, which I've used for today's brew." You gesture to the back of the room, "So everyone, please, say thank you to the woman who made today possible!". Everyone turns and softly claps, and you see your physician begin to blush.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_without_special_guest_event;"Recently, I visited a very special family friend of mine, and found out, like me, she was a lover of tea. She generously gave me a sample of ginger root from her own garden, which I've used for today's brew." You think of the woman sitting in her home, and part of you wishes she could be here to receive the praise she so rightly deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_option;Good for the heart, and the soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_option_tooltip;You pour a hot cup of green tea, and...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_bad_event;It only occurs to you now that how intensely bitter this ginger tea is. Thinking back, you never asked for the actual recipe your physician used, just for the ginger root itself. Even your guests, trying to be polite, can't help but wince with each sip.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_medium_event;Although you wouldn't call it flavorless, it's clear that the ginger tea you have is medicinal. Still, your guests don't seem to mind -- most of them are elderly, and they can appreciate a blend good for the heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ginger_root_served_good_event;What a unique flavor! Part of you believed the tea would be intensely bitter, but it is somehow bitter and... sweet? Whatever your physician gave you, it is her own creation, and you truly cannot think of another tea like this one. Your guests seem baffled, too, as you hear chatter flare up trying to solve the mysteries behind this wonderful blend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# post-tea evaluation
post_tea_bad_event;Instead of lively chat, your party is mostly murmurs. Your guests don't seem to have much to talk about, and are only taking small sips of the tea you've laid out for them. Perhaps the ingredients weren't as good as you hoped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_bad_option;Maybe they're just lost in thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_bad_option_tooltip;For a party, it's unusually quiet...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_medium_event;Lifting your kettle, you feel like your brew has almost run out. Your guests seem entertained, so you take a moment to sneak off back to the kitchen to make some more tea. Things are going well!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_medium_option;My guests are having a good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_medium_option_tooltip;You're having a very comfy day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_good_event;"Another cup!", calls one of your guests. "Same for me!", shouts another. Your colleagues are downing the tea so quickly, it's hard to keep up!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_good_option;Everything about today is perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_good_option_tooltip;Your guests will be talking about this party for quite some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# pre-determined post-tea event
hot_spring_water_tea_event;One of your colleagues pulls you aside, to privately ask you a question. "I hate to be a bother, but what did you put in this tea? Aches and pains I've grown to know have vanished, and my knees feel like they did twenty years ago!". You smile wryly, knowing full well the hot spring water has worked its magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hot_spring_water_tea_bad_option;Sorry, that's my secret to know.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hot_spring_water_tea_bad_option_tooltip;You keep the magic of the hot spring a secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hot_spring_water_tea_good_option;Sacred water, collected from a spiritual hot spring!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hot_spring_water_tea_good_option_tooltip;You profess your enamoration of the holy spring you found.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_event;"Here, let me show you the special way I mix the tea". Commanding a small audience, your physician grabs a handful of ginger root and a lukewarm kettle. Suddenly, from the spout, water pours upwards, dancing in the air. With masterful precision, she throws the ginger root in with one hand, whilst keeping the water afloat with the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_option;Of course, you must be a healer!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_option_tooltip;You realise your physician must be a master healer!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_option;A mystic of the Northern Tribes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_option_tooltip;You begin realising her health at her age makes sense, for a mystic such as herself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_option;You're a waterbender?!;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_option_tooltip;You are dumbstruck by this revelation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_event;"One of the oldest in our tribe, in fact!", she says, not missing a beat. The ginger root continues to swirl, making beautiful patterns, before pouring itself across several cups.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_normal_option;A healer, and a teabender, at my party!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_normal_option_tooltip;You're grateful your party has been attended by such a prestigious member of the tribe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_teach_option;Could you teach me the arts?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_culture_followup_teach_option_tooltip;You learn the basics of healing from your old physician.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_event;"I wouldn't call myself a mystic. Most girls are raised to heal, and I just happened to pick up a few other techniques along the way". The floating tea makes a few more dazzling swirls before dropping suddenly to the table, filling the cups of all those watching. "Truly, I've always thought of myself as more of a... teabender".;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_option;Of course, the fifth element!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_high_diplomacy_followup_option_tooltip;Your party has been blessed with such skill and entertainment!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_event;Your physician winks at you. "Yes, in my younger days I travelled the world, touring the Nations, and healing all those in need along the way. When I found my youth spent, I settled down, and became a simple family doctor." The tea in the air continues to swish and swirl, and finally lands to fill several cups. "A technique I've perfected over the years. Go on, try some!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_option;You're a teabender!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
doctor_is_waterbender_low_diplomacy_followup_option_tooltip;She may only know one element, but what an element it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_events;Strutting in from the kitchen, the Badger Spirit wanders into your tea room, to the surprise of your guests. Most seem to think it's just a pet, and some even scratch its head, of which it is oddly receptive. The weirdness only begins when the badger sits at your Pai Sho table, and abruptly lays out the pieces for a game.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_option;Who among you can defeat my trained badger?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_option_tooltip;You're not sure where this is going, but you're interested to watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_option;I will play the badger myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_option_tooltip;You'll probably be able to play it off as a joke, without anyone realising this is a spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_option;I'll play, but I must be wary of this spirit's knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_option_tooltip;Perhaps you can learn a thing or two from this creature?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_event;"I'll take that bet!", one of your guests boasts. The room roars with laughter as he sets up his pieces, and the man joins in with them. However, after just a few moves, it is clear the badger is the superior player, and the man is easily defeated. "How? What? This badger?", he sputters in disbelief. "I... don't know how you've managed to train him, but this badger... is a beast!".;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_option;He, uh, learned from the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_other_challenge_followup_option_tooltip;Your guests are impressed with your fictitious animal-handling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_event;Sitting down at the Pai Sho table, you place your pieces on the board. As the game unfolds, however, you realise the situation is helpless. The Badger Spirit is impossibly skilled, and seems to anticipate your every move. The match is over quickly, and your guests clap and laugh, thinking the entire thing was a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_option;I meant to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_self_challenge_followup_option_tooltip;You lost, but at least you learned something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_event;You sit down at the table, aware of what you're about to get into. Your guests laugh and clap, thinking this some elaborate joke, but you know better. Obviously there's no way to read your opponent, but it is a badger, but you can probably learn something from its moves. The game starts, and you realise quickly that this creature has perhaps centuries of Pai Sho knowledge under its furry pelt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_option;It is impossible to win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_option_tooltip;The Spirit's moves are impossible to counter!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_event;The game is over quickly, and the applause from your guests has only grown louder. To them, this whole thing was a show. But, gazing into your opponents beady eyes, you sense a real pride it has in victory. Smiling, you give a small clap, and congratulate the badger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_option;Well played, well played!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
badger_plays_pai_sho_wary_followup_followup_option_tooltip;You lost, but you walk away with a greater understanding of the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_event;So many more guests showed up than you expected, and as day wanes, you begin to hear whispers among the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_tooltip;You listen to the whispers...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_bad_option;Such nasty murmurs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_medium_option;It seems like a mixed bag...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_good_option;Everyone is talking about what a great time they had!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
extra_guests_evaluation_high_diplomacy_option;I should mingle and meet some new people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# post tea random events
post_tea_pai_sho_event;Cleaning up the tea cups and plates, you happily begin wrapping your party after a long day of revelry.

post_tea_pai_sho_badger_followup_event;Looking at each other nervously, the guests remark they feel too tired to play against such a... strange creature. Fortunately for them, the Badger Spirit seems to have vanished. Scouring the house for where it may have gone, you eventually happen upon a small bag hewn from badger fur, full of coins!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_pai_sho_badger_followup_option;The badger has gifted me for my hospitality!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_pai_sho_badger_followup_option_tooltip;You ponder the whimsical nature of the spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_play_instruments_event;With the main course served, you and your friends retire to your livingroom, for some delightful post-tea banter. Suddenly, you hear a soft-noise fill the room, and notice one of your fellow Tea Enthusiasts is gently playing a tsungi horn. Not wanting to miss out on the fun, you decide to join in yourself, with some singing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_tea_play_instruments_tooltip;You sing gracefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

post_tea_guest_asleep_in_bed_extra_guests_followup_option_tooltip;You think you'd have set a better example than that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
