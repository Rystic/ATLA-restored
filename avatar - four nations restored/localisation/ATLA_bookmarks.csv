BM_HUNDRED;The Hundred Year War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_HUNDRD_DESC;When Avatar Roku vanished, there was none left to oppose Firelord Sozin's ambitions to unite the entirety of the world under his rule.

BM_AZULON;Azulon's Inheritance;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_AZULON_DESC;Ever since Sozin invaded the Earth Kingdom, immeasurable bloodshed and destruction has spread across the globe. Now, the newly ascended Firelord Azulon knows the war his father started has dragged out longer than anyone thought possible. The Earth Kingdom has grown stronger and more unified under the military command of the Council of Five, an elite cadre of their best commanders. Meanwhile, in the freezing Arctic seas, the Fire Nation has suffering a humiliating defeat by the Northern Water Tribes.

BM_PRELUDE;Before the Storm;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_PRELUDE_DESC;The war waged between Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom has now raged for almost ninety years. Despite the careful plans of Firelord Azulon, the war reaches yet another stalemate as his armies finally come within sight of Ba Sing Se's towering and unassailable walls. As skirmishes continue across the continent, the Earth Kingdom's strength cannot be broken as long as its great capital stands. Yet, maybe even this will not go unchallenged, as a new champion of the Fire Nation, Crown Prince Iroh, slayer of the last dragons, dreams of conquering the insurmountable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Despite the losses suffered in the failed Siege of Ba Sing Se, the Fire Nation's army has continued to advance, the Earth Kingdom strongholds falling one by one. Meanwhile, the Navy prepares itself to once again attempt an invasion of the Northern Water Tribe.

Despite the losses suffered in the failed Siege of Ba Sing Se, the Firelord's army has continued to advance, the Earth Kingdom strongholds falling one by one before them.

BM_BM_ZUKO_DESC;Avatar Aang has defeated Firelord Ozai, and the Firelord's once dishonoured son, Prince Zuko, has seized the throne and has declared an end to the long war between nations. In the wake of this sudden and unexpected peace, uncertainty grips the entire world. While the Avatar has returned, it is unknown whether this truce is but a short lull in a conflict that has lasted generations.

BM_REPUBLIC;The Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_REPUBLIC_DESC;After years of skirmishes and hostilities following the end of the Hundred Year War, stability is slowly beginning to return. To solve the crisis created by the Fire Nation's colonies in the Earth Kingdom, a solution has been reached in which a new nation would be created, independent of both countries.

All this while a new, powerful militant group called the Equalists, emerge out of the continuing unrest in Republic City. Dissent grows around the world, and conflict appears certain.

BM_EMPIRE;The Earth Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_EMPIRE_DESC;After the assassination of the Earth Queen and the burning of Ba Sing Se, the Earth Kingdom ceased to be.

The world watches on with trepidation to see whether the Great Uniter will truly restore peace, or simply leave a trail of destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_CHIN_ERA;Avatar Kyoshi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_CHIN_DESC;With the death of feared and renown tyrant Chin the Conqueror, his empire has shattered into innumerable fiefdoms and warlords fighting over what remains.

BM_REBELLION;Ba Sing Se Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_REBELLION_DESC;The Earth King's attempt to reunite the entirety of the Earth Kingdom under his rule has gone spectacularly awry.

As the unrest continues, the Earth King has summoned Avatar Kyoshi to Ba Sing Se to resolve this crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_UNIFICATION;The Fire Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BM_UNIFICATION_DESC;Centuries ago, the once grand civilisation of the Sun Warriors began a slow and certain decline into extinction. Since then, the Fire Islands on which their kingdom once rested, have been a battleground between warlords and tribal chiefs warring for supremacy. That has all changed as one lord has taken control of a vast swathe of the main island, defeating the warlords there and establishing a new nation, a Fire Nation, with the sole objective of unifying all of the Fire Islands under his rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
