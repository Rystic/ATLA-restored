PET.1.OPTA;Something normal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.1.OPTB;Something regional;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.1.OPTC;Something truly rare;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.1.OPTD;Actually, I don't want a pet right now;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.2.D;One can't go wrong with a cat or a dog. They're the most classic companions of mankind for a reason! But an ostrich-horse can be just as fast a friend, if one raises it right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.2.OPTA;I'll take a cat;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.2.OPTB;I'll take a dog;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.2.OPTC;I'll take an ostrich-horse;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.2.OPTD;On second thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.3.D;There are so many strange and wonderful creatures through the world! But a ruler doesn't have time to keep a managerie. I'll have to content myself with...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.3.OPTA;A local specialty;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PET.3.OPTB;An Arctic Camel;;;;;;;;;;;;x

PETS.9.OPTA;I will cremate them, as is tradition;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PETS.9.OPTB;I will bury my friend myself;;;;;;;;;;;;x
