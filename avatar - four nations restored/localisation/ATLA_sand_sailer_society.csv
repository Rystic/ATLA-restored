sand_sailer_racers_desc;To navigate the near endless desert, the sandbenders use §YSand Sailers§! to move along the sand. A few years ago a couple of young and rowdy sandbenders thought it would be a great idea to start a sand sailer racing club, now various races are held amongst participating sandbender tribes for awards and bragging rights.;;;;;;;;;;;x
sand_sailer_racers_leader_desc;The current leader of the Sand Sailer Racers is the Race Overseer. They organise races and championships, handle rank ups and keep everyone in the club in check.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.40;Let's get to work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.50;I won't commit to this just yet.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.300;[Root.GetFirstName], we would be honoured to have you join the Sand Sailer Racers. The road to becoming a legendary sand racer, even a competent one, is long and winding. Through time and practice, you will achieve whatever it is you are seeking.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#########################RACE PRACTICE QUEST############################################
EVTDESC_SANDR.1010;[Root.GetFirstName], you and I know as well as anyone else in the club that practice makes perfect. You should hit the dunes sometime and improve your skills. Not saying you're a bad sailor or anything... Practice makes perfect though, right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR_1013;Dear [Root.GetFirstName], congratulations on completing your personal training. I hope the past few months have been very beneficial to you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_SANDR_1013;And beneficial it was...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1020;You climb aboard your trusty sand sailer and venture into the great Si Wong Desert. Beforehand, you planned out all the exercises and routines you will do, now all that needs to be done is proper execution of said exercises and routines.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1020;Let's get to work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1022;It has been a few exhausting weeks since you began your practice session. While speeding along the desert on your sand sailer, working on your turns and stops and speed ups under the hot sun you decide to practice a maneuver. §RWhich maneuver do you select?§!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1022;Hairpin Turn.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1022;Overspeed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1022;I should stick to the basics.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1023;I want to be the best sailor there ever was!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1023;Simply being a competent sailor will suffice for me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1023;What was I thinking about agai-ZzZzZzZzZzZ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1024;Your several month long practice session is soon coming to a close, and you decide one final grueling exercise is required. Most sand sailors go half the distance up the Si Wong Trail as a final exercise to their training sessions, but a bold few take the Old Si Wong Trail, a much longer and winding trail.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1024;I will take the Old Si Wong Trail!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1024;No need to kill myself out here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1025;You executed that maneuver perfectly! With success like this, who could possibly stand in your way?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1025;My practice to be the best continues.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1027;I'm sorry to hear about your injury while training, I wish you a speedy recovery [Root.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1027;I should be more careful next time...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1028;Everything happened so fast. One moment turns into the next and before you know it you are lying on the hot sand in the scorching sun. Also, you're in pain. A lot of pain. What went wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1028;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;x
OUCH;You fail your maneuver, and by extension your quest. Perhaps when your martial is higher or your bending skills improve you'll have a better chance at success.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1050;After it is all said and done, you feel much improved in your bending and racing abilities. The decisions you made during your training session paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1050;I feel much more stronger and healthy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1050;I feel as if my bending has improved!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1051;After it is all said and done, you feel that you have improved in your bending and racing abilities. You feel as if you could've went a little harder but nonetheless, you are a better sand sailor than you once were.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1051;I need to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1052;After it is all said and done, you feel as if you have fell short in your practice. You don't see yourself as a worse sailor compaired to when you started your session, but you don't feel improved.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1052;Not all is lost, as this still was a learning experience.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1023;You are sitting next to a small fire that you created deep in the Si Wong Desert. You are about halfway through your sand sailer practice. Night falls and you begin doze off, ready for sleep, but not before one final thought crosses your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;x

##################MAINTAIN SAND SAILER LOC####################################
sand_quest_sailer;Maintain Sand Sailer;;;;;;;;;;;x
sand_quest_sailer_desc;It is very important that a sandbender's sand sailer is maintained so it can preform at maximum efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;x
sand_quest_sailer_tooltip;Use the §RMaintain Sand Sailer§! decision to begin this quest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1030;Dear [Root.GetFirstName], one of the most important things a sand sailer racer can do is maintain their sailer. Look after it, and it will look after you. Speaking of maintaining sailers, yours is looking a bit undermaintained. See to it that you fix your sailer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1032;Word in the club is that [Root.GetFirstName] rides on a fast and nimble sailer. Good work [Root.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1032;Now it is time for my sailer to take care of me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1035;After looking your sailer up and down, you deem it necessary to replace only one of the four crucial parts to a sand sailer. The question is now, what part to maintain?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1035;The wooden frame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WOOD_CHAIN;The wood frame is very crucial to a sailer. Racing sailers are smaller and more nimble than the average sailer that roams the dunes and wood is scarce in the desert, but you come up with two good ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1035;The rope rigging.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ROPE_CHAIN;A very underlooked piece of hardware is the rope rigging used to rig the sail to the mast. How else is the sail supposed to stay on the mast? You decide this could be the easiest, but least rewarding part to pursue.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1035;The sail.;;;;;;;;;;;x
SAIL_CHAIN;You notice there are several holes of various small sizes in your sail. You could replace it, and it shouldn't be too hard to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1035;The compass.;;;;;;;;;;;x
COMPASS_CHAIN;All sand sailers need a compass. Though they aren't needed for race purposes, you notice that your compass doesn't even work. Should you replace it? (Completing this quest will remove it from being chosen again. Failure will allow you to attempt it again until you complete it.);;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1036;You decide to replace the wooden frame of your sailer. You come up with two options on where to go. Misty Palms Oasis where you should have a wide variety of options, with varying prices. Or you can head into the local tribal settlement and see what you can find. The people there would love to their §Blord§! buy local!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1036;I'll head to Misty Palms and try my luck.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1036;I'll stay local.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1037;There is no place quite like Misty Palms. Between the shady inns and even shadier locals hanging out in the alleyways you can't help but feel at home here. As you enter the town you ask a local woman for directions to the marketplace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1037;Let's hope this place has the parts I require.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1038;As you peruse the marketplace you finally find a sand sailer shop, tucked away in the back corner of the market. The prices are well... are not free but you decide it is what it is. As you consider the prices a shady voice calls out from an alleyway to your left, "You're [Root.GetTitledFirstName] right? If you need something fast and free, me and my boys are here for you!";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1038;I take the high road and buy a frame with qarid!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1038;My coffers aren't full right now, but I have some prestige to spare!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1039;Before you lay three options for a wood frame. A high quality frame for 100 qarid, a moderate frame for 50 and a cheap frame for 25 qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1039;I require the best!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1039;This will suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1039;Money is tight right now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1039;Those shady men are still standing there, menacingly...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1040;"Whatever you need in this town [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is yours, as long as you go through me and my boys here!" The assumed leader of the thieves says. You cannot even comprehend how they will steal an entire sailer frame, but you figure this cannot be their first time doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1040;Steal the good looking one!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1040;Get me that one!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1040;Get me... uh... that one...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1040;I am a [Root.GetTitle]! I should not be doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1041;You now have a sand sailer frame, how you acquired it isn't important but how will you install it, is. You can get some professionals through the race club to do it for you for a small fee, or try it yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1041;I'll hire the help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
prof_help;Hire help for 25 qarid and don't risk the chance of failure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1041;I'll do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dyi;You'll replace the wood frame by yourself, this could possibly end in a horrendous failure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1041;Wait... I know exactly what to do!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1042;After what feels like forever, you've finally finished replacing the frame... and it looks glorious. Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1042;Time to see what I can do!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1043;The helpful professionals you hired to replace the frame are finished, and your sailer looks great! Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1043;Time to see what I can do!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1044;Known amongst the sand sailers as "The Gauntlet" here in the northwest of the Si Wong Desert, the land changes from flat shifting dunes to canyons and spires of rock reaching to the sky in one fell stretch. The different conditions will certainly put you and your sailer to the test.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1044;Let's begin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1045;Before you lies a tucked away, yet winding and potentially challenging canyon. A balanced test, you can push yourself for fame or work on fundamentals and not risk anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1045;I'll try some new moves...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1045;I'll stick to the basics...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1046;Before you lies an expansive stretch of sand. With nothing but a heat haze on the horizon and the scorching sun overhead, this can be a great place to test your speed or your endurance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1046;Let's see how fast I can go!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1046;Endurance is the key.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1047;Ahead of you lies pillars of rocks that stretch upwards to the blue, cloudless skies of the Si Wong Desert. They are very dense in the center, and have more separation between them towards the outer edges of this region.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1047;Into the center!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1047;The outside pass poses some challenges as well...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE1_SANDR.1048;You've made your way through the canyon and you still remain in one piece, onto the next challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE2_SANDR.1048;After blazing across the hot golden sands, your next challenge comes into view...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE3_SANDR.1048;After navigating your way through the rock spire patch, you see your next challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE4_SANDR.1048;You've completed all the challenges of the Gauntlet! You'll be the talk of the club until someone new makes it through.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1048;What's next?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CASE1_SANDR.1048;Time for one final look over.;;;;;;;;;;;x
expensive_frame_a;Purchase an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
pricey_frame_a;Purchase an average wood frame for §Y50§! qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
cheapest_frame_a;Purchase a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
go_back;Go back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
expensive_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! prestige. Don't ask how they will get the job done, they always find a way. Also, there is a §R85§! percent chance your relationship with the trader will sour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
pricey_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an average wood frame for §Y50§! prestige. §R50§! percent chance of a negative opinion from the trader.;;;;;;;;;;;x
cheapest_frame_b;Have the thugs steal a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! prestige. Seriously, a cheap frame!?! This is someone's livelihood. Perhaps you could reconsider? No? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1049;After completing the three previous challenges you decide your new wood frame will work just fine for the races and practices ahead, at least for some time. Consider this quest done!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1049;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1054;Instead of going to the hustle and bustle of Misty Palms, you decide to visit the marketplace of one of the tribal villages you own. Who knows, you might find a bargain!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1054;Purchase an average frame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1054;Purchase a below average frame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1054;Purchase a... Pai Sho piece?;;;;;;;;;;;x
pai_sho?;You cannot even begin to fathom why this vendor is selling one singular Pai Sho piece. It seems only beneficial if there was someone out there missing this particular piece. You'll still have to buy a frame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1055;Everything was seeming so good until in an instant your sailer deconstructs itself right from underneath you. You live, you cannot say the same for your trusty sailer...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1055;How am I going to replace the ENTIRE sailer!?!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1056;You decide to replace the rope rigging of your sailer. You were recently informed that a caravan was sent out into the desert with various materials, perhaps they have some rope?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1056;I hope I can catch up to them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1057;You have been cruising along the shifting sand dunes searching for the caravan for a few days, to no avail. Just before you turn back to wherever you call home and call off the search, you spot something just on the horizon, distorted by the crushing heat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1057;It must be the caravan!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1058;It is the caravan! And they are all in one piece. As you pull up along side them the assumed leader calls out to you and wishes to know your business. You inform him you require replacement rope for your sailer and gesture to the frayed and tearing rope that is currently installed. The caravan leader, unaware that you are a [Root.GetTitle], says that he has plenty of rope can will sell it to you or give it you for free if you ride with them to their destination as a bender-for-hire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1058;Buy the rope.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1058;Tag along for the ride.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1059;You think it'll be best to buy the rope and part ways, but you can change your mind and help your fellow tribals if you wish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1059;Purchase the rope.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1059;Go back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1060;The exchange of money and goods is completed, and you and the caravan thank each other and part ways. On the ride back you can't help but wonder if they will make it to their destination, or will they meet a cruel fate at the hands of raiders.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1060;I'm sure they will be fine, right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1061;You agree to tag along and defend against any threats the caravan may face. Perhaps not the smartest decision a [Root.GetTitle] should be taking, but the people of this caravan are your subjects after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1061;Onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1063;After a week, the caravan makes it to their destination. The leader thanks you and gives you enough rope to replace yours. You exchange goodbyes and climb aboard your sailer, preparing to set off back to home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1063;What a journey!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1064;The first few days of the journey seemed uneventful, but on the dawn of the fifth day, sailers approach on the horizon and with them, raiders. Before you know it both parties dismount and begin battle. The raiders are disorganised and untrained and the upper hand seems to be yours, but before the day is won you find a raider charging you down!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1064;Charge back at them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1064;They charge like an amateur!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1064;Let them make the first move after the charge.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1065;The raider keeps charging, catching you off guard. You attempt spin out of it and their spear just cuts you. You are hurt, but still up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1065;Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1066;Instead of finishing the charge, the raider stops and waits for you. You have them right where you want them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1066;Take this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1067;The raider absorbs your attack but loses their weapon in the process. They charge at you and tackle you hard into the sand. Before a strike can be thrown a caravan member pulls the raider off of you and disposes of them outside of your field of vision.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1067;Thank [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1068;The carnage subsides and the raiders are no more. The caravan suffers no losses and quickly decides it is time to move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1068;This will be quite a tale for the courtiers back home!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1068;One day the desert will be free of raider scum.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1069;The caravan reaches it's destination and thanks you for your help. The rope is handed over along with some extra currency and you begin the journey home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1069;A journey for the ages!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1070;The search for the caravan is taking longer than you'd hoped for. But your spirit remains resolute, and you continue the search.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1070;They have to be out here somewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1071;The search is taking much longer than you'd hoped for, and you begin to worry about running into a raider band out here in the desert, all alone. You take one last look around and see something you missed before way off in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1071;What is that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1072;As you approach closer, the sad reality sets in. The caravan was attacked by raiders, mostly looted and left to be buried under the sand. Most of the caravan is already partially buried, and you notice one crate untouched by the raiders. Inside it is rope, you take it before anyone else can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1072;If only I was quicker...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1072;This will way heavy on my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1033;I heard about your wild adventure, [Root.GetFirstName]! Here's to hoping you got what you desired from it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

dyi;You'll replace the wood frame by yourself, this could possibly end in a horrendous failure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1041;Wait... I know exactly what to do!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1042;After what feels like forever, you've finally finished replacing the frame... and it looks glorious. Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1042;Time to see what I can do!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1043;The helpful professionals you hired to replace the frame are finished, and your sailer looks great! Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1043;Time to see what I can do!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1044;Known amongst the sand sailers as "The Gauntlet" here in the northwest of the Si Wong Desert, the land changes from flat shifting dunes to canyons and spires of rock reaching to the sky in one fell stretch. The different conditions will certainly put you and your sailer to the test.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1044;Let's begin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1045;Before you lies a tucked away, yet winding and potentially challenging canyon. A balanced test, you can push yourself for fame or work on fundamentals and not risk anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1045;I'll try some new moves...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1045;I'll stick to the basics...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1046;Before you lies an expansive stretch of sand. With nothing but a heat haze on the horizon and the scorching sun overhead, this can be a great place to test your speed or your endurance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1046;Let's see how fast I can go!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1046;Endurance is the key.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1047;Ahead of you lies pillars of rocks that stretch upwards to the blue, cloudless skies of the Si Wong Desert. They are very dense in the center, and have more separation between them towards the outer edges of this region.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1047;Into the center!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1047;The outside pass poses some challenges as well...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE1_SANDR.1048;You've made your way through the canyon and you still remain in one piece, onto the next challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE2_SANDR.1048;After blazing across the hot golden sands, your next challenge comes into view...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE3_SANDR.1048;After navigating your way through the rock spire patch, you see your next challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE4_SANDR.1048;You've completed all the challenges of the Gauntlet! You'll be the talk of the club until someone new makes it through.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1048;What's next?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CASE1_SANDR.1048;Time for one final look over.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1048;How was THAT for a run!;;;;;;;;;;;x
expensive_frame_a;Purchase an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
pricey_frame_a;Purchase an average wood frame for §Y50§! qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
cheapest_frame_a;Purchase a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
go_back;Go back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
expensive_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! prestige. Don't ask how they will get the job done, they always find a way. Also, there is a §R85§! percent chance your relationship with the trader will sour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
pricey_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an average wood frame for §Y50§! prestige. §R50§! percent chance of a negative opinion from the trader.;;;;;;;;;;;x
cheapest_frame_b;Have the thugs steal a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! prestige. Seriously, a cheap frame!?! This is someone's livelihood. Perhaps you could reconsider? No? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1049;After completing the three previous challenges you decide your new wood frame will work just fine for the races and practices ahead, at least for some time. Consider this quest done!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1049;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1049;That was exhausting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1054;Instead of going to the hustle and bustle of Misty Palms, you decide to visit the marketplace of one of the tribal villages you own. Who knows, you might find a bargain!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1054;Purchase an average frame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1054;Purchase a below average frame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1054;Purchase a... Pai Sho piece?;;;;;;;;;;;x
pai_sho?;You cannot even begin to fathom why this vendor is selling one singular Pai Sho piece. It seems only beneficial if there was someone out there missing this particular piece. You'll still have to buy a frame.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1055;Everything was seeming so good until in an instant your sailer deconstructs itself right from underneath you. You live, you cannot say the same for your trusty sailer...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1055;How am I going to replace the ENTIRE sailer!?!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1056;You decide to replace the rope rigging of your sailer. You were recently informed that a caravan was sent out into the desert with various materials, perhaps they have some rope?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1056;I hope I can catch up to them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1057;You have been cruising along the shifting sand dunes searching for the caravan for a few days, to no avail. Just before you turn back to wherever you call home and call off the search, you spot something just on the horizon, distorted by the crushing heat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1057;It must be the caravan!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1058;It is the caravan! And they are all in one piece. As you pull up along side them the assumed leader calls out to you and wishes to know your business. You inform him you require replacement rope for your sailer and gesture to the frayed and tearing rope that is currently installed. The caravan leader, unaware that you are a [Root.GetTitle], says that he has plenty of rope can will sell it to you or give it you for free if you ride with them to their destination as a bender-for-hire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1058;Buy the rope.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1058;Tag along for the ride.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1059;You think it'll be best to buy the rope and part ways, but you can change your mind and help your fellow tribals if you wish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1059;Purchase the rope.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1059;Go back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1060;The exchange of money and goods is completed, and you and the caravan thank each other and part ways. On the ride back you can't help but wonder if they will make it to their destination, or will they meet a cruel fate at the hands of raiders.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1060;I'm sure they will be fine, right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1061;You agree to tag along and defend against any threats the caravan may face. Perhaps not the smartest decision a [Root.GetTitle] should be taking, but the people of this caravan are your subjects after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1061;Onwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1063;After a week, the caravan makes it to their destination. The leader thanks you and gives you enough rope to replace yours. You exchange goodbyes and climb aboard your sailer, preparing to set off back to home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1063;What a journey!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1064;The first few days of the journey seemed uneventful, but on the dawn of the fifth day, sailers approach on the horizon and with them, raiders. Before you know it both parties dismount and begin battle. The raiders are disorganised and untrained and the upper hand seems to be yours, but before the day is won you find a raider charging you down!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1064;Charge back at them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1064;They charge like an amateur!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1064;Let them make the first move after the charge.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1065;The raider keeps charging, catching you off guard. You attempt spin out of it and their spear just cuts you. You are hurt, but still up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1065;Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1066;Instead of finishing the charge, the raider stops and waits for you. You have them right where you want them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1066;Take this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1067;The raider absorbs your attack but loses their weapon in the process. They charge at you and tackle you hard into the sand. Before a strike can be thrown a caravan member pulls the raider off of you and disposes of them outside of your field of vision.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1067;Thank [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1068;The carnage subsides and the raiders are no more. The caravan suffers no losses and quickly decides it is time to move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1068;This will be quite a tale for the courtiers back home!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1068;One day the desert will be free of raider scum.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1069;The caravan reaches it's destination and thanks you for your help. The rope is handed over along with some extra qarid and you begin the journey home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1069;A journey for the ages!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1070;The search for the caravan is taking longer than you'd hoped for. But your spirit remains resolute, and you continue the search.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1070;They have to be out here somewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1071;The search is taking much longer than you'd hoped for, and you begin to worry about running into a raider band out here in the desert, all alone. You take one last look around and see something you missed before way off in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1071;What is that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1072;As you approach closer, the sad reality sets in. The caravan was attacked by raiders, mostly looted and left to be buried under the sand. Most of the caravan is already partially buried, and you notice one crate untouched by the raiders. Inside it is rope, you take it before anyone else can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1072;If only I was quicker...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1072;This will lay heavy on my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1076;You notice there are several holes of various small sizes in your sail. You could replace it, and it shouldn't be too hard to do that. You can head to Misty Palms and visit the marketplace, or commission a local sail maker to make one for you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1076;Time to make a choice...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1177;What path do you choose to take?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1177;Go to Misty Palms;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1177;Search for a local sail maker;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1178;After arriving in Misty Palms, it does not take long for you to find a sail for purchase.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1178;Ten qarid it is!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1179;While walking out with your new sail, wrapped up and under your arm, you see a poor, presumptuously homeless beggar pleading for some qarid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1179;Take some qarid, poor beggar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1179;Perhaps someone else will take pity on you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCASE1_SANDR.1180;As you walk out of Misty Palms and return to your court, you can not help but think to yourself that you did a small part in making this seemingly inhospitable desert a better place, one good deed at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCASE2_SANDR.1180;As you walk out of Misty Palms and return to your court, you can not help but think to yourself that you did your part in keeping this crude and unpredictable desert a cruel place, one cruel deed at a time;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACASE1_SANDR.1180;The light can shine in the desert.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACASE2_SANDR.1180;Outsiders and good doers have a right to fear the desert.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1181;You have decided to stay away from the bustling marketplaces of Misty Palms and have dispatched personnel that will find a suitable sail maker from the local villages under your banner...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1181;And now we wait...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1182;After several weeks, word has reached you that the finest sail maker in your lands has been found, and is eagerly awaiting to be employed into your service. In matter of fact, she's actually already here, at your court!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1182;[sail_maker.GetFirstName] is exactly who I wanted, now get to work!;;;;;;;;;;;x
HIRE;Hire this craftswoman, and hope she produces a sail that will put the rest of the Sand Sailer Racers to shame!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1183;[sail_maker.GetFirstName] is not who I wanted, begone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
DECLINE_SAIL_MAKER;Send away this craftswoman and return to the sail quest chain decision hub.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1184;Now that [sail_maker.GetFirstName] is employed, how high quality of sail would you like her to attempt to create?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1184;A beautiful sail that can really catch the wind!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1184;I don't need it to be "pretty", I need it to work!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1184;Just make me a sail, and get out of my court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1187;You are awoken with bittersweet news. The sail maker you hired a while ago has passed, and her child arrives with money to reimburse you, their [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1187;She was a great woman, working on a magnificent sail for her [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1187;My condolences for your loss, child.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1187;Well she was uh, a woman, yes, a woman and that is for sure!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1188;The day has arrived, and the sail maker you hired presents to you your new sail for your sailer. She unfurls it and... it's the size of a small blanket, no good for a sand sailer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1188;Curse you [sail_maker.GetFirstName]! Curse you and your family name!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1189;The day has arrived, and the sail maker you hired presents to you your new sail for your sailer. She unfurls it and... it's magnificent with an impressive, intimidating design and pattern, and of ample size to really catch the wind to give you an extra boost in a race!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1189;This is exactly why I paid you well, [sail_maker.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1190;The day has arrived, and the sail maker you hired presents to you your new sail for your sailer. She unfurls it and... it has a simple pattern and looks to be about the same of other sails you see on racer's sailers. You wonder if this woman has made sails for other sailors in the club. Either way, it's a sufficient sail.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1190;Perhaps simple is best?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1191;The day has arrived, and the sail maker you hired presents to you your new sail for your sailer. She unfurls it and... it's a plain white sail with... stain marks on it? And at first glance you think it would barely catch any wind when rigged up on your sailer!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1191;You get what you paid for, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1138;I heard that you have a glorified bedsheet as a sail, [Root.GetFirstName]. I don't think you'll win many races with that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1138;Embarrassing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCASE2_SANDR.1032;I must say, [Root.GetFirstName], your new sail looks very good on your sailer. Almost as good as mine does! Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACASE2_SANDR.1032;One day you won't be laughing anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCASE3_SANDR.1032;I heard that the craftswoman you put in charge of creating a sail for your sailer has passed, I offer my condolences, and I also offer you a spare sail.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1032;Nice to know that the Race Overseer has a heart.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1192;When you get the time and chance to take a break from your duties as [Root.GetTitle], you ride on your sand sailer and enjoy being under the sun. All sand sailers have a compass that navigates a sailor towards the center of the Si Wong Desert. Today, of all days, you've noticed that yours is stuck pointing the same direction regardless of where you turn.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1192;Time to change out my compass.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1193;You inquire around the Sand Sailer Racers about where to find a new compass, you don't want any of the new ones in Misty Palms, they aren't built to last like a true compass is. After hours of inquiring you get a lead from a fellow racer that is enjoying his last week before retirement, "Seek out Sotan, who lives west of the Gauntlet, he may have what you need if you can make it there." The man says with pained breath. What kind of threat lies in the desert? Giant monsters? Evil spirits? You cast these thoughts away and return to your court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1193;I will seek out Sotan!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1194;After returning to court and preparing for your expedition west, in the midst of going over what you'll be bringing with you a courtier bursts into your chambers with your guards right behind ready to drag the courtier out. You order your guards to stand down and let the courtier speak. "I've heard where you're planning to go my [Root.GetTitle]! I beg you to reconsider, for it is dangerous and people from all around disappear and never are found! Please my [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1194;What can possibly exist in the desert?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1196;You convince the courtier that nothing will happen to you, and you bid farewell to everyone that is unaware of where you are going, under the guise of visiting Omashu. You set out westwards to the small village where Sotan resides.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1196;This journey will be long, but hopefully very rewarding!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1197;You pass by a small tribal community that seems to be packing up their things and leaving. Where are they going? What could cause this exodus? War? You press on towards the Gauntlet for fresh water and information.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1197;What is going on?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1198;You arrive at the Gauntlet late at night. A small camp community usually exists outside the entrance but there seems to be no one around. The campfires are all but smouldering embers and the tents are empty. There is an incredible silence that covers the entire area. Where did everyone go?;;;;;;;;;;;x
PRESS_ON;For the first time this trip, a shiver runs down your spine. You feel certain in the coming days you'll find out what is the cause of this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1198;Something truly is wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1199;You find yourself resting in the middle of the desert a few days after leaving the Gauntlet. The sight of empty, dark tents and the deafening silence of the abandoned campsite still assaults your senses. You close your eyes, unaware of what to make of what you saw. The village, the Gauntlet, what is going on? A few moments later you open your eyes, and notice things are a little darker than usual. You look around and then you see it. To the southwest, the largest sandstorm you could possibly imagine is barreling down upon you. A sandstorm not even epic stories could do justice to.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1199;Not now! Not when I'm so close to the village!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE2_SAND.1199;You decide to test your luck again and head west to the village where Sotan resides. You waste no time and set off right away. It doesn't take long for you to notice yet another sandstorm approaching from the southwest, just as great as it was last time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
THE_SANDSTORM;The Sandstorm;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1120;As the sandstorm gets closer and closer, and the sky darkens, you decide you need to make a decision. You can sail to the north, and find refuge in the close mountains. Or, you can continue west and brave the sandstorm if you dare, and waste no time getting to the village.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1120;I need to get to the village!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1120;I need shelter!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1120;If I curl into a ball I'll be fine!;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRAVEN_TT;You curl into a ball on the desert sand and let the sandstorm decide your fate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1121;You decide to head west and hope you run into the village. You waste no time and take off on your sailer. The wind seems to be in your favour, giving you an extra boost. You put all the energy you can muster into speed as the sandstorm catches up, with sand flying through the air, assaulting you. After what seems like hours of outrunning this sandstorm, you look up and see distant lights. An entire village, unafraid of the sandstorm!.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1121;Sotan better be here!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE1_SANDR.1122;You speed into the village and hop off your sailer. You run into a building that seems to present it's self as a inn. Once inside, you take a deep breath and exhale as the bulk of the sandstorm hits the village. The locals inside don't seem to be surprised with what is happening outside and are more interested in you. A local woman walks up to you, offering water. You accept and ask where you can find Sotan. "That crazy old hermit? He lives on the outskirts in a small hut by a dried up pond. Can't miss it." You wait until the sandstorm passes before heading out.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CASE2_SANDR.1122;You arrive to the village to see a handful of sandbenders bending the sand drifts out of the village center. It seems as almost everyone here can sandbend in some capacity. You ask a local if Sotan is here. "That crazy old hermit? He lives on the outskirts in a small hut by a dried up pond. Can't miss it.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1122;You better give me the best compass ever!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SANDR.1124;Sotan;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1124;You arrive at the small hut with the dried pond outside. You knock on the door but the door creaks open on the third knock. You enter and in a backroom you find an older man. Angered by something, he shouts, "I anticipated someone would visit me, but I'd thought they would have the sense to knock first!" Before you can say that you did knock, his angered face changes to a face of realisation. "You're a racer aren't you? I can smell it on you! Victory, wind and lots of sweat!" he says, following with an introduction, "I am Sotan, one of the many original racers in the Sand Sailer Racers! You are...";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1124;[Root.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1125;The sandstorm washes over you and it stings, it really, really, stings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1125;Is it over yet!?!?;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRAVEN2_TT;Your condition is too painful to continue, and you painfully turn back to your court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1126;As you make haste and set off west, giving it all you have, you realise it is not enough. The sandstorm devours you, and you are forced to stop and take refuge under your sand sailer. When the storm passes you lose your sense of orientation. You look to your compass then remember, your compass is broken.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1126;Lost!;;;;;;;;;;;x
compass_failure;To be lost in the desert is a horrible experience. Luckily for you, you manage to make your way back to your court in one piece, without a compass as well.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1128;"...And that's my story. Why I've come here to you." You say. After talking for a while joking and talking about the club, and Sotan recalling his "glory days", he understands your circumstance, and retrieves a wooden box from a shelf. He opens in and inside is a worn compass. You worry that this one is on it's last legs but Sotan assures it is perfect. "I trusted it and it trusted me. This compass has seen many victories and defeats, many places all around the desert and even beyond it. You can add to it's story now. It's yours.";;;;;;;;;;;x
SOTAN_TT;You bid Sotan farewell after exchanging more stories. He assures you that he will always be in your corner, rooting for your success from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1128;Thank you, Sotan.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1127;Heading northwards towards the mountains, you realise that they are further away they that looked at first. You press on and as the situation looked hopeless you notice a lone rock spire on the horizon in front of you, as if placed by a benevolent spirit. As you approach it you notice that there is an opening that you could crawl inside. You do just that and notice the spire in entirely hollow. You wait out the storm in here. When it passes, you'll continue west.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1127;Are one of the desert spirits watching over me?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1129;You've attempted to find a compass in the past and have failed, would you like to try it again?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1129;I will not fail this time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1129;Perhaps another part of my sailer needs improvement...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1034;I've seen a new compass on your sailer, [Root.GetFirstName]. Well, it doesn't look new but it works now. It does work right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1034;Yes, it does actually work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SANDR.1139;What happened to you, [Root.GetFirstName]? You look like you got skinned alive!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1139;I did. And it hurts. A lot.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#########################POWER EVENTS##############################
EVTDESC_sand.10;You have decided to run The Gauntlet. You gather what you will require and bid your farewells to your courtiers, letting them know you will return soon. You climb aboard your trusty sand sailer and begin your trek to the Gauntlet, to become a better sailer and racer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_sand.10;The journey begins.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_sand.11;After a little under two weeks, you've arrived at your destination. A small camp site is located before the entrance to the Gauntlet, where sailors prepare to enter or tell stories to other sailors before heading back to their homes. You've come here for one reason however, and that is to run the Gauntlet.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_sand.11;Time to enter.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_sand.12;You return to your court and remark your incredible run to your courtiers. The Sand Sailer Racers catch wind of your recent successful run and congratulate you. People will remark about your run until someone else makes it through, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_sand.12;I need a rest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_sand.13;Due to lack of skill, or perhaps luck, you fail this run at the Gauntlet in spectacular fashion. You can't remember what you hit but you are sent flying through the air and land hard on the hot sand.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_sand.14;After all the time you spent in the club, all the sweat, all the adventures you went on just to find some rope, you have become THE legend of the dunes.

EVTOPTA_sand.14;I am simply the greatest to ever do it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
