sand_sailer_racers_desc;To navigate the near endless desert, the sandbenders use §YSand Sailers§! to move along the sand. A few years ago a couple of young and rowdy sandbenders thought it would be a great idea to start a sand sailer racing club, now various races are held amongst participating sandbender tribes for awards and bragging rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sand_sailer_racers_leader_desc;The current leader of the Sand Sailer Racers is the Race Overseer. They organize races and championships, handle rank ups and keep everyone in the club in check.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SANDR.40;Let's race.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.50;I won't commit to this just yet.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.300;[Root.GetFirstName], we would be honored to have you join the Sand Sailer Racers. However, to join you must win a exhibition race against another new racer.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1010;[Root.GetFirstName], you and I know as well as anyone else in the club that practice makes perfect. You should hit the dunes sometime and improve your skills. Not saying you're a bad sailor or anything... Practice makes perfect though, right?;
EVTDESC_SANDR_1013;Dear [Root.GetFirstName], congratulations on completing your personal training. I hope the past few months have been very benefical to you.; 
EVTOPT_SANDR_1013;And benefical it was...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1020;You climb aboard your trusty sand sailer and venture into the great Si Wong Desert. Beforehand, you planned out all the exercises and routines you will do, now all that needs to be done is proper execution of said exercises and routines.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1020;Let's get to work.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1022;It has been a few exhausting weeks since you began your practice session. While speeding along the desert on your sand sailer, working on your turns and stops and speed ups under the hot sun you decide to practice a maneuver. §RWhich maneuver do you select?§!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1022;Hairpin Turn.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1022;Overspeed.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1022;I should stick to the basics.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1023;I want to be the best sailor there ever was!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1023;Simply being a competent sailor will suffice for me.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1023;What was I thinking about agai-ZzZzZzZzZzZ;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1024;Your several month long practice session is soon coming to a close, and you decide one final grueling exercise is required. Most sand sailors go half the distance up the Si Wong Trail as a final exercise to their training sessions, but a bold few take the Old Si Wong Trail, a much longer and winding trail.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1024;I will take the Old Si Wong Trail!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1024;No need to kill myself out here.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1025;You executed that maneuver perfectly! With success like this, who could possibly stand in your way?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1025;My practice to be the best continues.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1027;I'm sorry to hear about your injury while training, I wish you a speedy recovery [Root.GetFirstName].;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1027;I should be more careful next time...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1028;Everything happened so fast. One moment turns into the next and before you know it you are lying on the hot sand in the scorching sun. Also, you're in pain. A lot of pain. What went wrong?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1028;Ouch!;
OUCH;You fail your maneuver, and by extension your quest. Perhaps when your martial is higher or your bending skills improve you'll have a better chance at success.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1050;After it is all said and done, you feel much improved in your bending and racing abilites. The decisions you made during your training session paid off.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1050;I feel much more stronger and healthy.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1050;I feel as if my bending has improved!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1051;After it is all said and done, you feel that you have improved in your bending and racing abilites. You feel as if you could've went a little harder but nonetheless, you are a better sand sailor than you once were.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1051;I need to rest.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1052;After it is all said and done, you feel as if you have fell short in your practice. You don't see yourself as a worse sailor compaired to when you started your session, but you don't feel improved.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1052;Not all is lost, as this still was a learning experience.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1023;You are sitting next to a small fire that you created deep in the Si Wong Desert. You are about halfway through your sand sailer practice. Night falls and you begin doze off, ready for sleep, but not before one final thought crosses your mind.;

##################MAINTAIN SAND SAILER LOC####################################
sand_quest_sailer;Maintain Sand Sailer;
sand_quest_sailer_desc;It is very important that a sandbender's sand sailer is maintained so it can preform at maximum efficency.;
sand_quest_sailer_tooltip;Use the §RMaintain Sand Sailer§! decision to begin this quest.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1030;Dear [Root.GetFirstName], one of the most important things a sand sailer racer can do is maintain their sailer. Look after it, and it will look after you. Speaking of maintaining sailers, your's is looking a bit undermaintained. See to it that you fix your sailer.;
EVTDESC_SANDR_1032;Word in the club is that [Root.GetFirstName] rides on a fast and nimble sailer. Good work [Root.GetFirstName].;
EVTOPTA_SANDR_1032;Now it is time for my sailer to take care of me!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1035;After looking your sailer up and down, you deem it necessary to replace only one of the four crucial parts to a sand sailer. The question is now, what part to maintain?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1035;The wooden frame.;
WOOD_CHAIN;The wood frame is very crucial to a sailer. Racing sailers are smaller and more nimble than the average sailer that roams the dunes, wood is scarce in the desert but you come up with two good ideas.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1035;The rope rigging.;
ROPE_CHAIN;A very underlooked piece of hardware is the rope rigging used to rig the sail to the mast. How else is the sail supposed to stay on the mast? You decide this could be the easiest, but least rewarding part to pursue.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1035;The sail.;
SAIL_CHAIN;You notice there are several holes of various small sizes in your sail. You could replace it, and it shouldn't be too hard to do that.;
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1035;The Compass;
COMPASS_CHAIN;All sand sailers need a compass. Though they aren't needed for race purposes, you notice that your compass doesn't even work. Should you replace it?;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1036;You decide to replace the wooden frame of your sailer. You come up with two options on where to go. Misty Palms Oasis where you should have a wide varity of options, with varying prices. Or you can head into the local tribal settlement and see what you can find. The people there would love to their §Blord§! buy local!; 
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1036;I'll head to Misty Palms and try my luck.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1036;I'll stay local.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1037;There is no place quite like Misty Palms. Between the shady inns and even shadier locals hanging out in the alleyways you can't help but feel at home here. As you enter the town you ask a local woman for directions to the marketplace.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1037;Let's hope this place has the parts I require.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1038;As you peruse the marketplace you finally find a sand sailer shop, tucked away in the back corner of the market. The prices are well... are not free but you decide it is what it is. As you consider the prices a shady voice calls out from an alleyway to your left, "You're [Root.GetTitledFirstName] right? If you need something fast and free, me and my boys are here for you!";
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1038;I take the high road and buy a frame with gold!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1038;My coffers aren't full right now, but I have some prestige to spare!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1039;Before you lay three options for a wood frame. A high quality frame for 100 gold, a moderate frame for 50 and a cheap frame for 25 gold.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1039;I require the best!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1039;This will suffice.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1039;Money is tight right now.;
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1039;Those shady men are still standing there, menacingly...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1040;"Whatever you need in this town [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is yours, as long as you go through me and my boys here!" The assumed leader of the theives says. You cannot even comprehend how they will steal an entire sailer frame, but you figure this cannot be their first time doing so.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1040;Steal the good looking one!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1040;Get me that one!;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1040;Get me... uh... that one...;
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1040;I am a [Root.GetTitle]! I should not be doing this!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1041;You now have a sand sailer frame, how you acquired it isn't important but how will you install it, is. You can get some professionals through the race club to do it for you for a small fee, or try it yourself...;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1041;I'll hire the help.;
prof_help;Hire help for 25 gold and don't risk the chance of failure.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1041;I'll do it myself!;
dyi;You'll replace the wood frame by yourself, this could possibly end in a horrendous failure.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1041;Wait... I know exactly what to do!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1042;After what feels like forever, you've finally finished replacing the frame... and it looks glorious. Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1042;Time to see what I can do!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1043;The helpful professionals you hired to replace the frame are finished, and your sailer looks great! Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1043;Time to see what I can do!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1044;
 
expensive_frame_a;Purchase an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! gold.;
pricey_frame_a;Purchase an average wood frame for §Y50§! gold.;
cheapest_frame_a;Purchase a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! gold.;
go_back;Go back.;
expensive_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! prestige. Don't ask how they will get the job done, they always find a way. Also, there is a §R85§! percent chance your relationship with the trader will sour.;
pricey_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an average wood frame for §Y50§! prestige. §R50§! percent chance of a negative opinion from the trader.;
cheapest_frame_b;Have the thugs steal a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! prestige. Seriously, a cheap frame!?! This is someone's livelihood. Perhaps you could reconsider? No? Fine.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1049;After completing the three previous challenges you decide your new wood frame will work just fine for the races and practices ahead, at least for some time. Consider this quest done!;
