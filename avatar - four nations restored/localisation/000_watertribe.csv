wt_chief_of_chiefs_desc;The Chief of the Northern Water Tribe is now indisputably the ruler of all the Water Tribe. Both the Chieftains here swear their fealty and those in the south have come to recognise the strength and superiority of the North. It is time to make our status known to all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HYW_ally_earth_kingdom_desc;A great war rages between the nations, as the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom battle for supremacy. Previously, we have seldom involved or even shown interest in the affairs of foreigners, but as the casualties mount and the very balance of the world is shaken, we realise we must choose to aid the Earth Kingdom against the Firelord's ruthless war machine if either of our peoples are to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HYW_submit_fire_nation;Side with the Fire Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HYW_submit_fire_nation_desc;The Fire Nation has shown strength thought impossible in our forefather's age. As the Earth Kingdom falters, it may be wiser to attempt to befriend the clear victor in this conflict. If the Firelord is open to an alliance, there is perhaps a great many things our peoples can achieve together.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

submit_fire_nation_tt;We will ally ourselves with the §YFire Nation§! as a §YMilitary Ally§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.1;It is time for us to finally bring unity to the Water Tribe and bring our southern brothers back under our rightful rule. Though they may have thought they were beyond our reach in the distant South, we will show them there is no place in this world our authority cannot reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.2;Ever since our ancestors left our sibling tribes to make their own home in the South, the Chief of the Northern Water Tribe has continued to claim authority over us. While this authority has never been enforced, rumour now has it the North is preparing a grand campaign to subjugate the South. This rumour may be unfounded, but it is most certainly troubling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.3;Years after the Chief of the North declared a conquest of the Southern Tribes, that promise has gone  unfulfilled. Southern Chieftains still remain independent, and it is clear that this has done nothing more but divide the Water Tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.4;Years after the Chief of the North declared a conquest of the Southern Tribes, that promise has been fulfilled. The Southern Chieftains now bow and pay proper tribute to the North. It is clear that the Northern Water Tribe has never been stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.5;For years now, we have ruled over a sizable realm and led a hardy people. It is clear to our destiny is greater than even these heights. It is time for our fleets to leave the Arctic Seas and conquer the distant shores of the other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.6;Rumour has reached you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] Tribe is growing in ambition and strength. They are no longer satisfied with subjugating their neighbours, but have begun to plan conquests further abroad. Such greed may make [From.GetTitledFirstName] a future enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.7;The rule of the Chief of the North is now unquestioned. All the lesser Chieftains have been brought to heel and all the Tribes united under that banner. It is time for a new era of prosperity and direct rule over all the Water Tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.8;From decades, the Chief of the North has slowly expanded his rule, first subjugating the neighbouring tribes and then those of the Southern Water Tribe. Now that the North's authority is unopposed, their claim to rule all the Water Tribes is now unquestionable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.9;It may take many weeks for our envoys to sail for the Earth Kingdom and Ba Sing Se, but it is without little doubt that the Earth King is in need of any aid that can be found. Spirits willing, our peoples will be able to unite against the Fire Nation aggressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.10;An envoy of [From.GetTitledFirstName] recently arrived in Ba Sing Se, looking to establish an alliance between [From.GetHerHis] Tribe and the Earth Kingdom in the war against the Fire Nation. While in the past, we'd be reluctant to ally ourselves with such minor entities, in this current conflict, we may need any assistance the Water Tribe can offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.11;Our spies in the Earth Kingdom report that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has struck an alliance with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a chieftain of the Water Tribes. While a signal of desperation, it may mean the entire Water Tribes may side against us. One advisor suggests we make an example of the few Tribal's remaining in our borders, a small number of traders and travellers, to warn the Tribes we will not tolerate their interference.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.12;Our envoy has returned with a message from [From.GetTitledFirstName], accepting our offer of alliance. This is fortunate tidings for us and our struggle against the Fire Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.13;Our envoy has returned from Ba Sing Se with a message from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Apparently, the Earth King has totally dismissed any chance of alliance between our peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.14;After a discussion with the Tribe's leadership, an envoy has been dispatched in secret to travel to Fire Nation territory. It is a significantly risky journey, but for the sake of the future, our envoy should not fail in his mission to deliver our offer of alliance to the Firelord.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.15;An envoy from the Water Tribes was recently intercepted in Fire Nation waters, attempting to deliver a message from a [From.GetTitledFirstName] to you. [From.GetTitledFirstName] knows the Fire Nation's victory is inevitable and offers us an alliance. While many among the Court and the Military loathe the idea of allying tribals, [From.GetTitledFirstName] could prove a useful ally in future wars against the Water Tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.16;After months of silence, our envoy has returned from the Fire Nation, carrying a letter from the Firelord! It appears, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has seen the value of an alliance between our peoples. With this, we have secured the future for our Tribe. We must tread carefully though, for no doubt whispers of this alliance will spread to our fellow, less enlightened, Chieftains.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.17;After months of silence, our envoy has returned from the Fire Nation, carrying a letter from the Firelord! It appears, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has insulted us, dismissing all possibility of any alliance or truce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.18;After months of silence, our envoy has returned from the Fire Nation, carrying a letter from the Firelord and a gift in appreciation of our new alliance! [From.GetTitledFirstName] suggests we take a strong hand in forging peace between our two nations, and has offered ready assistance to help us subdue our neighbouring Chieftains who may not share our ideals of peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

watertribeOPTB.11;A sound suggestion. Have them all executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

oasis_pilgrimage;Visit the Spirit Oasis;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oasis_pilgrimage_desc;It is said within the Spirit Oasis at the heart of the Northern Water Tribe, the great Spirits known as Tui and La dwell, circling one for eternity. Forever have the Spirits of the Moon and Ocean guided and protected our people. Surely, at least once a lifetime, the leader of our tribe should visit their sanctuary to offer proper thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.100;The time has come to set out to visit the Spirit Oasis and offer thanks to the Spirits. In the meantime, you will leave leadership of your people in the hands of another until you return.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPT.100;It shouldn't be that long a journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.102;The vast distance between your home and the great Spirit Oasis demanded that you travel by sea through the treacherous northern waters. Thankfully however, the sea is merciful and your ship continues it's journey without danger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTA.102;We are lucky to sail in such calm weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTB.102;We must offer tribute to Tui and La for this safe passage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.103;The vast distance between your home and the great Spirit Oasis demanded that you travel by sea through the treacherous northern waters. When storm clouds gather in the distance, your crew grow ever more anxious to go onwards. The captain suggests a traditional gift to the Ocean Spirit would calm the crew's nerves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTA.103;Very well, a tribute must be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.104;The vast distance between your home and the great Spirit Oasis demanded that you travel by sea through the treacherous northern waters. When a storm catches your ship mid-journey, a great deal of crew and supplies are lost. While you survive, your delayed arrival and dwindling food bring you a painful sickness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTA.104;I'm just glad to have survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.105;After a long journey, you finally arrive in the magnificent city at the heart of the Northern Water Tribe, home to the great Spirit Oasis. Here, a great many merchants from both the Tribe itself and the lands beyond gather to trade. Surely, taking some time to have a look at their wares wouldn't be amiss?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESCA.105;It is no greater honour to rule the magnificent city at the heart of the Northern Water Tribe, home to the great Spirit Oasis. Here, a great many merchants from both the Tribe itself and the lands beyond gather to trade. Surely, taking some time to have a look at their wares wouldn't be amiss?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTA.105;I have no interest in purchasing trinkets on this occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTB.105;Perhaps I could acquire a few luxuries while I'm here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTC.105;Perhaps a gift to bring home to my dear [Root.GetHusbandWifeOpp]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESC.106;After a long journey, you finally arrive in the magnificent city at the heart of the Northern Water Tribe, home to the great Spirit Oasis. From here, the Chief of the Northern Tribe rules from a splendid palace. While you are within the city, it might be diplomatic to pay a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESCA.106;It is no greater honour to rule the magnificent city at the heart of the Northern Water Tribe, home to the great Spirit Oasis. In your recent preparations for your ritual visit to the Oasis to honour the Spirits, you feel there could be a greater sense of festivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESCB.106;After a long journey, you finally arrive in the magnificent city at the heart of the Northern Water Tribe, home to the great Spirit Oasis. Once, the Chief of the North ruled this city and protected the Oasis, but now, it has fallen into the hands of miscreants who know no gratitude to the Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTA.106;Yes, this is a cause for great celebration!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTB.106;This is a time to honour the Spirits, not distract ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTC.106;I shall merely admire such a grand city...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTD.106;Yes, a visit to the ruling chief would be a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTE.106;One day this city should be freed from their tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeTITLE.200;Water Tribe Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESCA.200;Word is spreading of a great victory over the Earthbenders, as [From.GetTitledFirstName] has defeated them on their own territory, beating the forces of one of their leaders known as [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. There hasn't been a Tribe who've held territory beyond the Arctic regions for centuries, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] has accomplished this feat. Whether or not this conquered territory remains held is in doubt, but if it can be done, it would signify to the whole word that the Water Tribe's strength is unquestionable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESCB.200;News is spreading through the Earth Kingdom of the defeat of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] forces at the hands of a Water Tribe leader known as [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Through trickery or luck, these Tribals have apparently managed this victory, conquering the rightful lands of the Earth Kingdom. Many of the nobility agree that these Tribals should not get too used to unfrozen land, for it won't be long until they are driven back from whence they came.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeDESCC.200;News has reached us from across the seas that there has been a startling upset in the Earth Kingdom. The tribal forces of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have recently dealt a defeat to an Earth Kingdom noble named [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Water Tribe Chief not just defeating [Root.GetHerHis] forces, but seizing Earth Kingdom territory itself. Perhaps it is not a question of if, but rather when [From.GetTitledFirstName] will lose control of this conquered territory to the native lords. If these gains aren't reversed however, it could signify how powerful the Water Tribes are growing in military strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTA.200;There are many conquests to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTB.200;An interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
watertribeOPTC.200;Those Tribals will not hold our land for long!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
