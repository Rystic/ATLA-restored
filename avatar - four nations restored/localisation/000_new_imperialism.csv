EVTTOOLIPIMP_TENYEAR_DELAY;Has not been less than ten years since the start of our last campaign.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_0;Destiny of the Fire Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_0_desc;The time has come for change in the world. This will open a new path for the Fire Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_1;The Colonies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_1_desc;In your hands is the greatest empire in history. The time has come to share that prosperity with the world. Numerous areas have been identified as the ideal location to establish what might be the first of many colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
# imperial_ambitions_2;Colony Settlements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
# imperial_ambitions_2_desc;Now that our foothold in the Earth Kingdom is secure, we can send more waves of colonists to settle in the area. It will take a small investment from the royal treasury to ensure our subjects have everything they need to establish any new colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_4;Found Imperialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_4_desc;It is time to begin a new chapter in Fire Nation history. There should be no higher authority in this world than the Firelord, and all loyal subjects should vow their undying loyalty. More so, it is time to show the rest of the world the power of the superior element. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_5;Imperial Pride;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_5_desc;It is time to embark upon a campaign to remind this nation of it's pride. Military parades shall be held in the cities, festivals in the outlying villages. They should all know without a doubt that we are the most cultured and advanced nation in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_6;The Waking Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_6_desc;It is time to usher in an era of industry for the nation. By building factories to take the best advantage of our resources, we will improve our wealth and military strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_12;Prepare Air Temple Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_12_desc;The Avatar is dead and has been reborn into the Air Nomads. As long as they exist, the Fire Nation is threatened. When the Great Comet arrives, we must seize our destiny and destroy the Airbenders. With one element removed from the world forever, the Avatar Cycle will surely be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_13;Fire Supremacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_13_desc;Advisors have suggested yet another campaign to sway the citizens way of thinking. Any future military endeavour will require patriotic citizens to fight in our armies. We must once again remind the nation that we are the world's supreme power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_14;Navy Shipyards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_14_desc;For any war, we will need the navy to transport our forces to anywhere in the world. We must construct a massive new shipyard near the Capital, to provide us with the strong fleet we'll need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_15;Establish the Southern Raiders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_15_desc;We can construct an outpost on Whaletail Island to serve as a vital military base from which we can attack the Southern Water Tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_16;Recruit the Rough Rhinos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_16_desc;We can fund an effort to found an elite military order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_17;Recruit the Yu Yan Archers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_17_desc;We can recruit the nation's best archers to form a new elite military order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_18;Pledge Loyalty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_18_desc;We can pledge our loyalty to the Firelord and vow to serve him above all else;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_19;Mandatory Education;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_19_desc;The Ministry has devised yet a new initiative to better the citizenry. By funding a national education system, we can better influence the next generation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_20;Attack the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_20_desc;If the Avatar was truly slain with the Air Nomads, then they were reborn into the Water Tribes. By attacking the Southern Water Tribe's Waterbenders, there is great enough chance we will capture the Avatar and prevent their future interference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_21;Declare Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_21_desc;We must coordinate our military might to force the Earth Kingdom back province by province, until we have eradicated their antiquated nation. We can plan a military campaign against individual regions of the Earth Kingdom, continuing on until we control it completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_22;Recruit the Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
imperial_ambitions_22_desc;The mountain people of the north have always resented their subjugation by Ba Sing Se, and have longed to break free of them. It is time to intervene on their behalf and offer the petty kings and warlords of the mountains a place by our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
restoration_ambitions_0;Restoration of the Earth Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_0_desc;Too long has the king had no power in his own kingdom. As foreign vultures approach our shores, we must seize control once more to save our birthright.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_1;The Royal Mail Service;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_1_desc;The Dai Li control the Palace, and we must be able to gather supporters without their interference. The creation of a Royal Mail Service, with the public aim of speeding up correspondence between the Kingdom's bureaucracy, would be the perfect cover for creating a secure delivery service for our messengers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_2;The Royal Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_2_desc;We will need men we trust at our side when it comes time to seize power. If the Palace is to remain secure, it must be guarded by the best soldiers in the Earth Kingdom and above all else, those solely loyal only to their King.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_3;Watch the Watchmen;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_3_desc;The Dai Li have spread their influence far and wide over Ba Sing Se, and they no doubt have many bases and outposts spread throughout the city. Before we can ever move against them, we must find these locations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_4;Royal Allies;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_4_desc;All that remains is to find allies who can aid our struggle. The Dai Li are a numerous and elite force, and we will need the support of nobles both within and beyond Ba Sing Se to defeat them.Aksu;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;
restoration_ambitions_5;Seize Power;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_5_desc;The time has come to overthrow the puppeteers who have ruled Ba Sing Se, and restore true authority back to the Earth King. Loyalists will seize control of the city, but the Grand Secretariat will resist our efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_6;Seize Power;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_6_desc;The Royal Mail Service;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_9;Restore The Walls;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
restoration_ambitions_9_desc;The once grand walls of Ba Sing Se are in decay. We must invest a hefty sum to bring them back to their former glory;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
break_away_from_earth_kingdom;Declare Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
break_away_from_earth_kingdom_desc;We can break away from the weak Earth King's rule and forge our own destiny. This carries a great risk of reprisal, but in doing so we will finally no longer bend our knees to Ba Sing Se.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
pledge_to_earth_king;Rejoin the Earth Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
pledge_to_earth_king_desc;Long has the entire continent been ruled by the Earth King, but our lands have since slipped from Ba Sing Se's control. Alone, we are vulnerable to attack, but if pledge our fealty to the Earth King once more, we may again receive his protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
form_earth_empire_ek;Centralise the Earth Kingdom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
form_earth_empire_ek_desc;With the restoration of my authority across the continent, it is high time to put in an effort to centralise the land once and for all. The Earth Kingdom shall never be divided again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
rebuild_empire;Restore Chin's Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
rebuild_empire_desc;It is our destiny to rebuild Chin the Great's Empire! It is time to announce that destiny to the world, and forever remind it of Chin's legacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
water_tribe_build_stronghold;Build Stronghold;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
water_tribe_build_stronghold_desc;It is time to build not only a home fitting for a Tribe as great as your own, but a fortress that within they are safe. The resources this will require however, are considerably significant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESCIMP.0;A new age has dawned for the Fire Nation. Ahead of us, there are many pathways. We may pursue choices that will unify, industrialise or expand our great nation. Though we may focus on only one endeavour at a time, progress will flower wherever you direct your attention. From here forward, you shall usher in a new era in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.1;The time has come to expand your nation. The Earth Kingdom is plagued by division, weakness and strife. It is the Fire Nation's destiny to take it as our own. We have sent out scouts to find locations for future colonies, so that we may secure our place on the continent's shores. The Avatar however, may disapprove of our progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.2;Our forces have moved into Yu Dao, clearing the area of local resistance. Local commanders believe that the land is secure. Now all that remains is to dispatch the first wave of settlers to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.3;Our scouts have returned, reporting that there are a number of promising locations. The War Council advises that Yu Dao should be our first choice as a future colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.4;The Imperial Philosophy is embraced in the royal court, but it will take time and effort for the nation's traditions as a whole to change. As Firelord, you must see that the nobility and commoners come to realise their nation's true path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.5;If we are to further our borders, we must expand our colonies further inland. Further expeditions will be launched to survey the neighbouring region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.6;Word has spread of your new Imperialist doctrines to all the Fire Nation now. Traditionalists such as the Fire Sages have dared to criticise your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.7;This will be one of many efforts to convince the citizenry to lend their full hearted support to their nation's cause. While many won't be swayed in a day, some may be properly reminded of their true loyalties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.8;A province has affirmed their loyalty to the crown. These loyalists know their Firelord commands more respect that any Spirit, Sage or even Avatar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.9;The two year campaign has concluded. While the nation is far from united under the new Imperial Philosophy, a great many loyalists have pledged their allegiance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.10;A number of more important nobility have chosen to embrace the ideal of a supreme Fire Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.11;Ministers hare prepared a year long campaign to industrialise the nation. Factories are already a common sight in the capital, now we need to encourage this new wave of industry across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.12;Our investments seem to be paying off. Our encouragement has had local burghers invest their own funds into setting up a factory in their local province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.13;One of your subjects has come before you asking for royal investment into their province. For a small cost, we can choose to back the establishment of a factory there. While this will be indeed beneficial, it will no doubt benefit the investor more than it will benefit us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.14;Our current campaign for industrialisation has come to an end. We have yet begun to even draw on more than a minuscule of what this great nation is capable of. More industry will be required to support future military endeavours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.15;The expeditions we dispatched a year ago have returned with detailed surveys of the Earth Kingdom. We are ready to expand our colonies further inland and along the Western Coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.16;Since you moved into your new home, you can't help but feel a surprising number of things have changed. Things are very different living here on the continent, far from our homeland. The hard conditions demand change, a colonial way of life perhaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.17;Our forces have moved into Garsai, clearing the area of local resistance. Local commanders believe that the land is secure. Now all that remains is to dispatch the first wave of settlers to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.18;Our Settlers have arrived in the Earth Kingdom, establishing a new colony there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.19;Our forces have moved into Badaji, clearing the area of local resistance. Local commanders believe that the land is secure. Now all that remains is to dispatch the first wave of settlers to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.20;It is in our strategic interest to construct another colony on the continent. If our capture of Yu Dao proved anything, it's that the Earth King is too weak to stop us. Han Tai will be our next acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.21;Our forces have moved into Han Tai, clearing the area of local resistance. Local commanders believe that the land is secure. Now all that remains is to dispatch the first wave of settlers to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.22;It is in our strategic interest to construct another colony on the continent. If our capture of Yu Dao proved anything, it's that the Earth King is too weak to stop us. Qizhaicun will be our next acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.23;Our forces have moved into Qizhaicun, clearing the area of local resistance. Local commanders believe that the land is secure. Now all that remains is to dispatch the first wave of settlers to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.24;It is in our strategic interest to construct another colony on the continent. If our capture of Yu Dao proved anything, it's that the Earth King is too weak to stop us. Xitaozi will be our next acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.25;Our forces have moved into Xitaozi, clearing the area of local resistance. Local commanders believe that the land is secure. Now all that remains is to dispatch the first wave of settlers to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.26;It is in our strategic interest to construct another colony on the continent. If our capture of Yu Dao proved anything, it's that the Earth King is too weak to stop us. Beisu will be our next acquisition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.27;Our forces have moved into Beisu, clearing the area of local resistance. Local commanders believe that the land is secure. Now all that remains is to dispatch the first wave of settlers to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.28;Faced with the Avatar's ultimatum, we must abandon all future military campaigns for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.29;The Royal Council has already drawn up plans for where funds will be invested. Over the course of the next two years, our propaganda efforts will hopefully sway a significant portion of the population to our way of thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.30;The two period set out by our previous edict has expired and the funds have all been invested. We now know for sure a great many more provinces now recognise their true loyalty is to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.31;It is by necessity that we will launch a military campaign that the world will forever remember. When the Great Comet arrives, we will seize upon it's power to launch our final assault upon the lesser peoples. For now though, our generals have years to plan how best to utilise the momentary advantage the Comet will provide us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.32;We have invested in a project to construct a massive shipyard in the capital. This effort will take years, and may face some hurtles, but the Admirals assure us this project will be greatly worth while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.33;After two years in construction, the Capital Shipyard is finally complete. From here we will build the ships that will secure our borders and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.34;It appears that we've suffered some minor setbacks in the construction of our new shipyard. Missing construction materials have left workers idle. We will have to cover the loss to keep this project running on time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.35;This new shipyard project has given many opportunities for our military to rethink just how we construct our warships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.36;The Komodo Rhinos are a common creatures found among the wilderness of our homeland. Long have they been used as both beasts of burden and war. A recent commander has requested funding to found an elite order of riders that will be known as the Rough Rhinos and we have seen fit to fund the effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.37;After years scouring the nation for the best Rhino riders, they have finally been recruited into our new elite cavalry force. The Rough Rhinos will be of great use in the far stretching plains of the Northern Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.38;As we expand deeper into Earth Kingdom territory, it is becoming clear we are still quite outmatched when unable to bring the enemy into close range combat. Many archers however, have distinguished themselves and a commander from stronghold in Pohai recommends we create an elite unit of such talented bowmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.39;After searching the army for our best and most talented archers, we have organised them into the Yuyan Archers, based out of the Pohai Stronghold. They are our best bowmen, able to shoot targets tiny as the individual fly out of the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.40;While most of our military efforts are focused on the North Earth Kingdom, our supply lines down south have come under threat from Water Tribe attackers. Our commanders have advised constructing a base on Whaletail Island from which we can establish a Southern Raider force to strike back against the Waterbenders and possibly form the spearhead of an invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.41;After two years of work, a new navy base has been built on Whaletail Island. From here, we will finally be able to launch attacks on the Southern Water Tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.42;The Ministry has fully outlined a two year plan for the introduction of mandatory education and a national curriculum approved by the Ministry itself. While no doubt it will trouble some traditionalists, it will overall improve the education standards of the nation as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.43;Our latest efforts in a certain province seem to have been met with great success, by all reports. The people there have welcomed the introduction of new system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.44;It seems our efforts to improve the lot of the nation's youth has not gone appreciated in a certain province. It seems the people there greatly opposed to 'elimination of local traditions' and are considerably unhappy with the new laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.45;After two years, the Ministry has deemed the introduction of mandatory education complete. While it has no doubt angered some traditionalists, overall we have inspired a great deal of youth to future military service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.46;News has arrived that the Firelord's soldiers have made landfall on the western coast of the Earth Kingdom, taking control from the local nobility after fierce fighting. This blatant act of aggression has been met only with apathy from Ba Sing Se, setting a dangerous precedent that will no doubt enable the Fire Nation to establish more colonies in the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.47;News has arrived that the Firelord has seen fit to establish a colony on the Earth Kingdom's western shores. This will no doubt open up more opportunities for the nobility to profit from these newly acquired territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.48;In the aftermath of our successful campaign against the Air Nomads, it is clear it is a worthwhile option to destroy our enemy outright. The Southern Water Tribes are a clear enemy, but we cannot devote our full attention to their destruction. Instead, the War Council suggests we eliminate their benders, removing them as a threat and paving the way for future conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.49;The Commander of the Southern Raiders has received your orders, and has prepared a fleet for the attack on the Southern Water Tribes. As the Avatar may have reincarnated into the Water Tribes, we should look to capture as many enemy Waterbenders as possible in hope of finding them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.50;Our troops in the south have successfully discovered and captured an enemy Waterbender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.51;After a fierce battle, the Fire Nation raiders attacking your home managed to trap you in their nets, dragging you off back to their metal ships?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.52;One of your Tribe has fallen into the hands of the enemy, captured in the Raids. Though the battle is over for now, the Tribe shall go on with great sorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.53;For a long time, the South has lived in peace. Now however, the Fire Nation has began a terrifying campaign against your people. The target of their ruthless raids appears to be the Tribe's Waterbenders. It's clear they intend to wipe out those most capable of stopping their attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.54;Our troops in the south have successfully discovered and killed an enemy Waterbender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.55;As Firebenders attack your home, one such raider manages to thrust a spear into your chest. Within seconds, you leave this world behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.56;One of your Tribe has perished at the hands of the enemy, as the Fire Nation continues it's campaign to wipe out all Waterbenders. Their bravery in this fight will be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.700;Our strategists have identified the regions which we should attack. The war cannot proceed deeper into the Earth Kingdom until we completely secure the necessary border regions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.701;Word has come that the entirety of the Hu Xin Provinces has fallen under the control of the Fire Nation. While a devastating loss for the Earth Kingdom, most believe such a defeat was inevitable ever since the Fire Nation first moved into the Provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.702;Messengers have brought word that the Fire Nation armies are beginning an offensive to capture the Hu-Xin Provinces. One of the more affluent regions on the continent, its loss would be a terrible blow to the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.703;As of late, we have found ourselves bordered by the invading Firebenders. Now, a massager from the Firelord has arrived, offering an alliance and a chance to break free of Ba Sing Se's tyranny. Long have the people of the Mountains been subjugated by the lowlanders, but are we really desperate enough to swap one foreign ruler for another?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCIMP.704;Word is spreading that the Firelord has struck an unlikely alliance with the Mountain People of the North, convincing these often called 'Barbarians' to join the war against the Earth Kingdom. This bodes ill for their enemies, as Fire Nation ranks are reinforced with hardened mercenaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.0;We have a bright future ahead of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.1;Onwards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.2;A glorious victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.3;This is awful news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.4;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.5;The old men can waste their breath for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.6;The occasion justifies any cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.7;We're not concerned for such trivialities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.8;We can afford to pay this cost for the sake of industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.9;The treasury can't afford such an enterprise at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.10;Someone will suffer for this error;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.11;This is a good result;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.12;Excellent Work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.13;They will be avenged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAi.14;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTOPTAiH.700;The navy must secure the Earth Islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiI.700;We'll invade the Southern Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiJ.700;Gaoling will be the best target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiK.700;Onto the Goalan region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiL.700;Secure the Sikouzi region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiM.700;We'll go up the East Coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiN.700;Time to finally take Omashu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiO.700;Secure the South-West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiP.700;Time to bring the rest of the world in line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiA.701;A great victory for our nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiB.701;Worrying news for the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiA.702;A glorious victory no doubt awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiB.702;What terrible news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiA.703;We'll fight for the Firelord, if only for revenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiB.703;We'll stick with the King for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAiA.704;Let's hope these Barbarians can live up to their end of the bargain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESCHYWA.0;Heralds from Caldera City arrived today, proclaiming a new era on behalf of the Firelord. It is apparent that the Air Nation and Earth Kingdom conspired to attack our great homeland, but the Firelord has foiled their schemes with a preemptive strike. All foreigners are now enemies of the Fire Nation, barred from her shores. Furthermore, we will not rest until we subdue the Earth Kingdom barbarians. The Fire Nation is now in a state of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWB.0;In the wake of an event now rapidly becoming known as Sozin's Comet, the Fire Nation has launched a genocidal assault upon the Air Temples, most likely to hunt down Avatar Roku's successor. The Fire Nation's intent to conquer the entirety of the world is undeniable now, and unless they are forced from our shores, the Earth Kingdom may be be annihilated forever, just as surely as the Air Nomads. This is surely the beginning of a Fire Nation war upon all other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWC.0;We feared the arrival of the Great Comet with much dread, and now it appears our concerns were well placed. News is already spreading of Fire Nation fleets making their approach. As Air Nomads, we have always sought peace, but it is now clear that the Fire Nation has no such inhibitions. No doubt they hunt the Avatar, but who knows what they are capable of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWD.0;We have begun our campaign to destroy the Air Nomads and Avatar, and the Fire Nation must be ready for this war. After today, the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes will no doubt attack once they realise their inevitable destruction. Once we are finished with the Air Temples, we must continue our conquest of the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWE.0;It is coming clear that when the Great Comet appeared in the skies, the Fire Nation has launched a genocidal assault upon the Air Temples, most likely to hunt down Avatar Roku's successor. The Fire Nation's clear intent is to conquer the world. While the Earth Kingdom will no doubt go to war to defend themselves, our people for now are neutral in this conflict. Perhaps in the future, we may take a stand against the Fire Nation, but for now, this is not our fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.1;News is spreading fast of the Firelord's plan to invade the other nations. A war so grand that millions will lose their lives and their homes. With the world on a knife's edge, the Avatar is on his way to confront the Firelord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.2;The Avatar has finally learned of the Fire Nation's territorial growth and has demanded you cease your expansion and withdraw the colonies. It is clear that spreading civilisation goes against the Avatar's misconceived notions of 'balance'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.3;It becomes quickly clear you are no match for a fully realised Avatar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.4;We have given into the Avatar's demands for now. The colonies have been dismantled and the military is outraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.5;The Avatar may have forced a peace on us for now, but the colonies we have built thus far will remain intact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.6;News has spread of the Avatar's confrontation with the Firelord. After a tense encounter, the Firelord bowed to the Avatar's demands and agreed to remove his colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.7;News has spread of the Avatar's confrontation with the Firelord. The Royal Palace has been destroyed and the Firelord left humiliated. While the Firelord's colonies will stay, the Fire Nation's expansion has been halted for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.8;Today, the Royal Astrologer delivered the news that he is now certain that in two decade's time, the Great Comet will return. In legend, it's arrival has always been the herald of great upheaval, granting heightened abilities for those who wield the power to bend fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.10;A volcano on Avatar Roku's home island has erupted. As the Avatar fights the lava flow it is clear that even he is no match for such a disastrous force. You leave him to die, ensuring he will never interfere with your destiny again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.11;The Western Air Temple has fallen. The generals assure us that no Airbender escaped the attack. To be sure, we will establish minor outposts nearby to keep watch for any survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.12;The Northern Air Temple has fallen. The generals assure us that no Airbender escaped the attack. To be sure, we will establish minor outposts nearby to keep watch for any survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.13;The Southern Air Temple has fallen. The generals assure us that no Airbender escaped the attack. To be sure, we will establish minor outposts nearby to keep watch for any survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.14;The Eastern Air Temple has fallen. The generals assure us that no Airbender escaped the attack. To be sure, we will establish minor outposts nearby to keep watch for any survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.15;Fire Nation forces have stormed your home, killing whoever they encounter. Powered by the Comet, they are unstoppable. There is no time for escape, no way out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.16;The island which you've called home has suddenly experienced disaster. The volcano has erupted and you must hold it off long enough for everyone to escape. You're strength might not be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.18;The Great Comet is but five years away now. You're generals have devised how we can best take advantage of it's effects. On the year of the Comet, we must be ready to storm the Air Temples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.19;Spiritual leaders have recently alerted us to the approach of a cosmic object, a comet, that in a couple of years time will hurtle through our skies. While there is no specific reason to be alarmed, such events have always been bad omens for the world. Suffering has always followed in the comet's wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.20;Every century, a light hurtles through the sky and lights up the world in dreadful red glow. This day has long been foretold by the sages, and feared by many more. This fire in the sky empowers those who carry fire within, allowing them to perform feats of Firebending usually considered impossible. In the lands of Fire, the Comet always leaves great turmoil in it's wake. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.23;The time has come to launch the assault upon the Air Temples. Our commanders predict with well coordinated strikes, we can ensure the complete destruction of all four Air Temples and their populations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.24;With the fall of Ba Sing Se, the Earth Kingdom is no more. While resistance remains, it is now only a matter of time until the Firelord turns their attention to conquering the few regions still free of Fire Nation control. This could very well be the end of the Hundred Year War, and the beginning of a world under the complete control of the Fire Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.25;The Fire Nation Capital of Caldera City has fallen to the army of the Earth Kingdom. Deposed from their seat of power, the Fire Nation now will have no choice but to surrender to the Earth Kingdom's terms. This spectacular victory is not just the end of the Hundred Year War, but a symbol of the Earth Kingdom's unsurpassable might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.26;The Fire Nation Capital of Caldera City has fallen to the Water Tribe. Deposed from their seat of power, the Fire Nation now will have no choice but to surrender to the Water Tribe's terms. This spectacular victory is not just the end of the Hundred Year War, but a definite sign of the Water Tribe gaining greater power in the wider world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.27;The Fire Nation Capital of Caldera City has fallen to the Air Nomads. Deposed from their seat of power, the Fire Nation now will have no choice but to surrender to the Airbender's terms, once again restoring peace to the world. This reversal of fortunes was foreseen by none, and this victory proving that the Airbender's are far more than capable of defending themselves against unprovoked aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.28;With the Hundred Year War concluded, it comes down to the victorious to decide the Fire Nation's fate. A peace treaty may perhaps be the best conclusion, as continued occupation of the Fire Islands would likely be disastrous. Dissolving the Fire Nation may be an option, but who knows what could emerge out of the chaos?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.29;The Avatar has proved themselves an obstacle to our ambitions before. The War Council is concerned that the Air Nomad Avatar will master the four elements before the Great Comet arrives. If so, that closes the window of opportunity the Comet presents us. Perhaps a pre-emptive strike against the Avatar's people is in order, to end their interference before it can begin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.30;The Avatar has always been an obstacle to our ambitions, and now with Avatar Roku dead, they will be reborn into the Air Nomads. The thought of one of those stifling traditionalists holding the world's fate in their hands is intolerable. It has been a recent suggestion, that with the power that the Great Comet will grant us, we should storm the Temples, find and neutralise this Avatar before they are revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.31;The Avatar has always been an obstacle to our ambitions, and now they will be reborn into the Air Nomads. The thought of one of those stifling traditionalists holding the world's fate in their hands is intolerable. It has been a recent suggestion, that with the power that the Great Comet will grant us, we should storm the Temples, find and neutralise this Avatar before they are revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.32;As the Air Temples burn, you escape into the night only to plunge into the icy sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.33;For all known history, the world has relied on the Avatar to keep the peace and balance of the world. Now, as the Air Temples burn, the Avatar is nowhere to be found. It is becoming very likely they perished in the attack. The world watches and waits for a new Avatar to emerge among the Water Tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.34;After facing an ultimatum from the Avatar, the Firelord has chosen to dissolve the colonies. While that should mean our immediate exile, instead we have simply been left self-reliant. That means we no longer have the support of our homeland, and will be forced to fend for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.35;The Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom are finally at war. We should again swear our loyalty to the Firelord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.36;We can no longer stand by and watch as the Fire Lord wages his senseless war against the world! The time has come for an uprising to overthrow him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.37;It appears some dissidents have staged an uprising against their Firelord. They dare accuse you of leading the Fire Nation astray by shunning the Spirits and many other disgraces. This rabble of petty criminals, angry spiritualists and foolish rebels stand no chance against the might of your army. The War Council assures you this rebellion will be swiftly crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.38;The uprising has been mercilessly crushed and it's leaders brought to justice. All that matters now is what judgement their Firelord will pass upon them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.59;For a while, a rebellion among the lower tiers of the city has been stirring. Now, a powerful Earthbender has started a rebellion against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.60;The King has been overthrown and the Kingdom is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.62;News has spread that a new King has ascended to the throne of Omashu, an eccentric but powerful Earthbender known as Bumi. While many both within and beyond the Earth Kingdom say they think little of this supposed madman, others believe him to be a genius.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.64;News has spread that Firelord Sozin has died. While the Fire Nation has moved to crown a new Firelord, Sozin shall be forever renowned for beginning an era of Fire Nation dominance over the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.65;News is spreading that Firelord Azulon has died. Having inherited his father empire, he may not have matched Firelord Sozin's personal renown, but he will be remembered as a hero to the Fire Nation none the less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWA.66;Reports have returned to us that the Firelord's forces have emerged victorious over the Air Nation. The Firelord has ordered celebrations across the Fire Nation to commemorate this victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWB.66;Rumour has spread that the Fire Nation campaign against the Air Nomads is over, and that a merciless purge has seen the Airbenders made extinct. If this is true, then one of the four elements has been completely erased from the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWA.67;After years of conflict, it appears the Air Nation will continue hinder us. Their mountaintop fortresses have proved to be near unassailable and now that Sozin's Comet is long past, we no longer have the means to properly attack them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWB.67;After years besieging the Air Temples, the Fire Nation has been forced to begin to retreat as the Air Nomads hold their ground. While the Firelord hoped for a quick and deceive extermination of the Airbenders, it is clear that the Airbenders will continue to survive for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWC.67;After a decade fighting against a genocide of our people, it appears we are victorious for now. The Firebenders have begun to withdraw, but the war is no means over. After so much violence, many Airbenders don't know if we can still claim that we have stayed true to the ways of our ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.70;I am no doubt the greatest of father's children, but yet the throne will not be mine. I will not stand for this. I will ask father's permission to claim what is rightfully mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.71;Today, Prince Azulon came before you. Apparently, he begs your permission to allow him to prove that he, not [From.GetTitledFirstName], is worthy of being your heir. He seeks that you allow them to duel to prove who is truly worthy of the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.72;Father has apparently refused, scorning my efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.73;Father has decided to allow the duel. The time has come for me to prove my worthiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.74;Today, Prince Azulon approached you, challenging you, his own sibling, to duel for the future of the crown. Shockingly, father has apparently given this his approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.75;It turns out [From.GetTitledFirstName] does not have the stomach to fight for [From.GetHerHis] birthright. Rumour is already spreading beyond the court of [From.GetHerHis] cowardice in the face of Prince Azulon's challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.76;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has proven a coward, and in response, father has chosen to revoke [From.GetHerHis] place in succession!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.77;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted your duel. You have prepared for this day, and now has come the time to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.78;You have met your treacherous brother for your duel. You do not plan to let this insult pass without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.79;You strike forward, aiming for a killing blow on [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.80;[From.GetFirstName] crumbles, your fire overcoming them in seconds. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] did not expect you to be so ruthless, but that matters not now. One are one step closer to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.81;Your brother goes for a killing blow straight away, but you dispel the Firebending attack. It is clear he means to fight to the death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.82;[From.GetFirstName] survives your initial attack, dispelling it before responding in turn with Firebending of their own. You press again for victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.83;You crumble, fire rushing over you as the Prince overwhelms your defences. Scarred by flames, you have lost the duel and your birthright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.84;You press back, driving Azulon back until with a single decisive swipe, you burn him, winning the Agni Kai. He crumbles to the ground, clearly disgraced beyond measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.85;Word has arrived that Prince Azulon has defeated [From.GetTitledFirstName] in an Agni Kai. He has proven himself stronger than his sibling, but you wonder if this was truly worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.86;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has triumphed over Prince Azulon in their Agni Kai. Azulon himself is disgraced for now, and will no doubt give up his ambitions for the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.88;You and your men are travelling through the province when one of your Earthbender's hears cries from a nearby cave. After journeying inside for a short while, he comes back to you with a malnourished baby girl. You'd think it nothing more than an unkind abandonment if not for the ornate blanket keeping the infant warm and the supplies left in the cave. Clearly, someone intended to return for her, but never did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.89;Six years after you adopted her, your daughter has been alike any other child. Recently however, she has become much more shy and secretive. When you finally ask, she reveals that she has started bending, Airbending more specifically. After hearing all the stories of how the evil Firebenders slaughtered the Air Nomads, naturally, the child is very scared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTITLETLA.92;A Vision For The Future;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCTLA.92;In recent weeks, your [chosen_son.GetSonDaughter] [chosen_son.GetFirstName] has shown an even greater enthusiasm for the war effort than usual, conversing with some of the Nation's more experienced generals and commanders. Finally, [chosen_son.GetFirstName] requests an audience to present [chosen_son.GetHerHis] proposal.\n\nThe conquest of the vast city of Ba Sing Se, whose walls have never before been breached. While many of your commanders believe such a siege would bring heavy losses, [chosen_son.GetPrincePrincessCap] [chosen_son.GetFirstName] is convinced that with our latest siege engines, best troops and the right leadership, Ba Sing Se could finally fall. More than that, [chosen_son.GetPrincePrincessCap] [chosen_son.GetFirstName] is even more eager to lead the campaign personally. While this decision is not an easy one, if [chosen_son.GetPrincePrincessCap] [chosen_son.GetFirstName] is right and the time to take Ba Sing Se is now, such a victory could be the end of this long war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.92;Summon the Council, maybe the hour of victory is upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.92;I cannot gamble so much on such a risky venture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.93;Such an effort will not be an easy thing, but in the space of two years, Minister [Root.job_marshal.GetFirstName] believes that we can assemble the forces necessary to lay siege to the Earth Kingdom's capital. Every factory is working overtime, and a widespread conscription effort has been launched to find the men necessary for this campaign. It will take some time until we are ready to launch such a campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.93;Such efforts will no doubt be costly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.97;The day has finally come and [SHDS_GENERAL.GetPrincePrincessCap] [SHDS_GENERAL.GetFirstName] has launched [SHDS_GENERAL.GetHerHis] invasion, landing troops in the region around Ba Sing Se. The newly founded 'Dragon' Army may be inexperienced, but well makes up for it in numbers and some of the best equipment we can supply. We hold great hope for their victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.97;Ba Sing Se must fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.106;You are honoured to fight in what will be the deciding battle of this war, leading your men against the great walls of Ba Sing Se. One night however, returning from a skirmish along the walls, you and your men are caught in an ambush by Earthbenders. Surrounded, you all quickly perish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.106;For the Fire Nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTITLEHYW.107;A Prince Falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.107;You are writing orders when a messenger rides in, shouting for your attention. After the confusion of this hasty arrival clears, he brings you the worst of news. Your [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName] was caught in a sudden counter attack! Reinforcements were not able to arrive in time, and [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName] fell in battle! Grief overwhelms you as you contemplate the death of your [From.GetSonDaughter]. Is this what your dreams of conquest have brought you? You falter, staying silent as your commanders shout around you, begging for you to answer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.107;Fight if you wish, I refuse to go further!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.107;We'll avenge [From.GetFirstName] and bring this city to its knees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE_107_rightous_path;You will abandon the Siege of Ba Sing Se, withdrawing your men so no more die against those terrible walls. With this, the Dragon's Host will be dissolved and all ground gained within Ba Sing Se will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE_107_vengence_path;You will continue your conquest of Ba Sing Se, despite the mounting costs, in hopes of bringing an end both to the sprawling city and the Earth Kingdom itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
all_men_conscripted;Widespread Conscription;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPHYW093;For two years, we will prepare to besiege Ba Sing Se. In the meantime, widespread conscription for the campaign will deplete our nation's manpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.94;In the morning, Minister [Root.GetMarshalName] appears before you, along with the guard, to explain that your [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName], has disappeared from the palace, along with a small flotilla of warships and transports from the city's harbors. It appears, [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName] has not been deterred by rejection, defying orders to take a small fleet to the Earth Kingdom. What [From.GetSheHe] plans, no one knows, but no doubt this an effort to force your hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.94;Very well then, the [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] will have our support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.94;This foolish venture will be a lesson enough. I will not aid it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPHYW094A;We will transfer control over all territory we have in the North-East Earth Kingdom to the Dragon Host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPHYW094B;We will leave the Dragon Host to fight alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.0;Fire will triumph as the superior element.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.0;We will defend our homes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhC.0;We will watch on for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWA.110;Word has come that the Firelord has finally committed to the Siege of Ba Sing Se, sending forth the greatest host our nation has yet seen under the command of General [SHDS_GENERAL.GetFirstName]. A decisive victory now could finally signal an end to this long war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYWB.110;Word is spreading that the Fire Nation is finally moving to assault the Earth Kingdom's capital of Ba Sing Se. It appears the Firelord has committed the last reserves of the Fire Nation's grand army to this decisive battle, placing them under the command of the renown General [SHDS_GENERAL.GetFirstName]. While Ba Sing Se's defences are said to be insurmountable, the attacking army is nevertheless vast...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.110;We shall see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.110;The fool! Those walls have never fallen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.111;You and your forces have retreated from the Siege around Ba Sing Se, setting sail back to the homeland. Though it fills you with sorrow to admit defeat, you cannot find it in your heart to press on with already so much lost. For now, you will wait, and wait for the Firelord's answer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.111;I need some time to grieve?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTITLEHYW.112;Siege's End;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.112;News is spreading that the Siege of Ba Sing Se has been broken, with the armies of General [From.GetFirstName] calling a retreat from the city. With this sudden withdrawal, Earth Kingdom forces have been able to drive the last remnants of the Fire Nation army from the Outer Ring, ending their occupation of territory within Ba Sing Se. This will prove a major defeat for the Fire Nation, which gambled heavily on General [From.GetFirstName]'s assault succeeding. With new volunteers gathering to the Earth King's service, this may mark a turning point in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.112;We will push them back even further!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.112;[From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName] will answer for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhC.112;Such a terrible defeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhD.112;This is an unexpected outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE112_EARTH_FORCES;With the Siege of Ba Sing Se over, our forces are regrouped and are ready to stand against any future threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.113;News is spreading fast that the outermost wall of Ba Sing Se has indeed fallen to the invading forces of the Fire Nation, with General [From.GetFirstName]'s army marching into the city's Agricultural Ring. Ba Sing Se's lifeblood is imperiled by this attack, which has sent shock-waves through the Earth Kingdom. If the defenders cannot drive them out, the city will surely fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.113;A glorious victory for our Nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.113;Shocking news indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.114;The Earth Kingdom's worst fears have come to be realised. Ba Sing Se agricultural region, already scarred by war, has been lost to General [From.GetFirstName]'s invading forces. The great capital city is now in more peril than ever as it is encircled by the Dragon's Host. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.114;The city will surely fall now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.114;Ba Sing Se is without hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhC.114;We will suffer for this lost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.115;The bloody siege of Ba Sing Se continues on, with the Dragon's Host continuing the assault, having now breached the Lower Ring of the city, pouring into the slums and industrial regions of the great city. It is perhaps here they will be halted, but there is sign of them stopping any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.115;They are closer to victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.115;Ba Sing Se is in dire straits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.116;General [From.GetFirstName] has taken [From.GetHerHis] conquest further than anyone thought possible, conquering what were thought as unassailable defences, and now, breaching the Middle Ring of Ba Sing Se. The heart of the Earth Kingdom's capital now burns as the Inner Ring itself comes under threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.116;What a feat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.116;The noose draws ever tighter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTITLEHYW.117;Ba Sing Se Falls!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.117;Once thought unconquerable, the jewel city and capital of the Earth Kingdom has fallen to the invading forces of General [From.GetFirstName]. With the city now in the clutches of the Dragon's Host, the Earth Kingdom's existence itself is threatened as the leader of the Dragon's Host sits upon the Royal Earth Palace's throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.117;The greatest victory in Fire Nation history?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.117;The sun has set on the Earth Kingdom...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhC.117;My Kingdom! My Kingdom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhD.117;Finally, my Ambition is fulfilled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.118;News is coming much clearer to you now. It has been confirmed that [FromFromFrom.GetPrincePrincessCap] [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] fell on the battlefield around Ba Sing Se, causing [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] [From.GetFatherMother], [From.GetFirstName], to break from the battlefield in grief. So much has been spent, yet, it seems all of this has been for naught. This is a major military disaster for the Fire Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.118;Perhaps the bloodshed must end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.119;It seems your [FromFrom.GetBrotherSister], [FromFrom.GetPrincePrincessCap] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], is unworthy of the lofty rank bestowed upon [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] has failed to take Ba Sing Se, instead fleeing into exile, so easily broken by the death of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] child. It is obvious you are the only worthy heir, [From.GetFatherMother] only needs confirm it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.119;I am sure [From.GetSheHe] will see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.120;It seems your [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetFirstName], has the impenitence to come before you and ask for you to confirm [From.GetHerHim] as your successor in place of [From.GetHerHis] [FromFromFrom.GetBrotherSister] of [FromFromFrom.GetPrincePrincessCap] [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] in the wake of this great tragedy. It seems [From.GetHerHis] ambition outweighs his sense! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.120;You are right, [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] has failed me? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.120;I will punish you for this, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE120_Accept;You will accept [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName]'s recommendation and make [From.GetHerHim] your rightful heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE120_Deny;You will dismiss [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName]'s blatant grab for power, and put [From.GetHerHim] in [From.GetHerHis] place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ba_sing_se_besieged;Ba Sing Se Besieged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.121;It seems [From.GetFatherMother]'s age has muddled [From.GetHerHis] mind. [From.GetSheHeCap] clings to [From.GetHerHis] loyalty to your failure of a sibling. Worse yet, [From.GetSheHe] has declared [From.GetHerHis] intent to punish you for merely telling [From.GetHerHim] the facts of the situation! It is clear the old fool needs to be dealt with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.121;My [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife], [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], may be of assistance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE121_Accept;You will take the chance to dispose of your [From.GetFatherMother] yourself, slaying [From.GetHerHim] in the midst of night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.121;I will do the deed myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE121_Deny;You will manipulate your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife], [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], into carrying out the assassination for you, using [Root.Spouse.GetHerHis] expertise to poison your [From.GetFatherMother] in the midst of night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.122;Sleeping that night, you are stirred from your sleep by the sound of a creaking door. By time you stir to consciousness, you already feel a pinprick on your skin. You rise for a final time to see [From.Spouse.GetFirstName] walking from your chambers. Too weak to cry out, the darkness swallows you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.122;No?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.123;The deed is done and your [From.GetFatherMother] is dead. Gathering the Sages, you quickly legitimize your claim on the throne in the absence of other claimants. The Fire Nation is yours. All that remains now is tie the last loose end, your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]. Exile is the greatest mercy you can grant [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] in this case, for one who has killed a Firelord?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.123;All has fallen into place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.127;Sleeping that night, you are stirred from your sleep by the sound of a creaking door. By time you stir to consciousness, it is too late, as a hand muffles your voice. The last thing you see is your own [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetFirstName], taking your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.127;?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.128;Slipping in the dead of night, you dispose of your [From.GetFatherMother] yourself. In the morning, you proclaim yourself Firelord, with your supporters quickly crushing any dissent. Many suspect you, but it is too late now as your ascend the throne, victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.128;The throne that is rightfully mine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE128_USURPER;All the aristocracy suspects you having played a part in the Firelord's sudden departure from this world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.129;It seems [From.GetFatherMother] has seen your wisdom and made your [From.GetHerHis] heir. Uncertainty grips you however, as it is only a matter of time before one of your sibling's supporters attempts to convince [From.GetFatherMother] to reconsider. Perhaps succession needs to be sped along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.129;Quite right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAE131_CLEAR;Though the timing of the Firelord is quite suspicious, the fact that you are the rightful heir dismisses any doubts about your right to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.132;A letter has arrived from [From.GetFirstName], written in the very halls of the Earth Palace itself. The heart of Ba Sing Se has been secured, and our forces there will work swiftly to crush any holdouts within the city. The Earth Kingdom has fallen, its final hope lost. Our victory is now certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.132;Forever shall history praise [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.133;It appears [FromFrom.GetBrotherSister] [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s campaign has been successful, the jewel of the Earth Kingdom falling into [FromFrom.GetHerHis] undeserving hands. [From.GetFatherMother] venerates [FromFrom.GetHerHim], praises [FromFrom.GetHerHim], and leaves you forgotten. You must move quickly if you are to seize your true destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.135;Recently, you have overheard that your [From.GetFatherMother] will be hosting a meeting with the War Council today. While not expressibly forbidden from attending the proceedings, you are not invited either, but as a [Root.GetPrincePrincessCap] of the Fire Nation, it is only right that you play a part in such matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.135;I will go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.136;Once inside the meeting, you try to remain discrete, but when you overhear a general planning to sacrifice countless soldiers needlessly, you challenge his foolishness. The room is aghast with this insult. It appears this disrespect will have to settled between you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.136;I accept the challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.137;You are in the midst of a war meeting when your [From.GetSonDaughter], [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName], shamefully disrupts proceedings, challenging the logic of your strategy. Such a display in front of the war council is unacceptable, and you are left to deal with this arrogance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.137;We'll settle this as proper: Agni Kai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAETOOLTIP137A;You will punish this infraction as demanded, giving your own blood no special treatment. You will retaliate for this insult as proper, in the tradition of Agni Kai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.137;The boy wants to fight! Then off he can go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLAETOOLTIP137B;You are above fighting your own child. If the boy wants to know what it is to sacrifice yourself for one's nation, he will learn soon enough from experience. You will banish [From.GetHerHim] on a hopeless quest to enemy territory until you find that [From.GetSheHe] has learnt [From.GetHerHis] lesson or [From.GetSheHe] perishes..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.138;The time of the Agni Kai has come. The foolish boy is caught by surprise, thinking [FromFrom.GetSheHe] would be facing one of your men instead of you personally. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] falls to his knees and begs for forgiveness, shaming [FromFrom.GetHerHis] family with cowardice before the entire arena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.138;I will teach you respect, and suffering will be your teacher...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.139;The time to resolve the challenge has come. You rise in the Agni Kai arena, to find that it is not the General you insulted you are fighting, but it is your [From.GetFatherMother]. In shock, you cannot raise you hands, and instead beg for reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.139;Please [From.GetFatherMother]! I meant no disrespect?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.140;[From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName] pleads for mercy like a child, shaming [From.GetHerHis] family and leaving you with no choice. Unleashing a torrent of fire, you quickly bring an end to the duel. Retainers remove the [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] quickly as possible from view of the shocked crowd. You leave only orders, that when the [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] awakens [From.GetSheHe] is banished, never to return until redeemed of [From.GetHerHis] dishonour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.140;Another problem solved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.141;You awaken from the duel scarred by the flames beyond repair. It is not long before the news is delivered to you. You have been banished from the Fire Nation on pain of death, till either death or you regain your honour. This ruling is final.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.141;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.142;You often hear of royal proclamations from the capital, but the latest shocks you. It appears that [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName] has been banished from the Fire Nation, either until death or until found redeemed. It appears a grave mistake caused the Firelord to deliver such a harsh punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.142;What a terrible fate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.143;You were present when [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName] was dealt the most cruellest of fates by the Firelord. Now, [From.GetSheHe] is to be exiled from the Fire Nation altogether. You do not do much in your own seclusion, but now, you believe you have found a new purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.143;I must offer my help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.144;The day has come for you to set out, alone. You hear of only one thing that might redeem you in the eyes of the Fire Nation, completing the hunt started your ancestors and capturing the Avatar, a threat that has existed for a hundred years. Only then, maybe, your [FromFrom.GetFatherMother] will welcome you home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.144;I will find the Avatar, and reclaim my honour?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.145;The day has come to set out into exile, but you do not go alone. Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName], has joined you in your quest. You will complete what your ancestors set out to do and bring the Avatar home in chains. Only then, may you be redeemed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
HUNT_PRINCE;Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
HUNT_PRINCESS;Princess;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
PRINCES_HUNT;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s Hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.150;The deadline set for [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName]'s departure has passed, and you hear that [From.GetSheHe] has somehow managed to make it beyond the Fire Nation's borders alone. Rumour has it the [From.GetBoyGirl] thinks if he finds the Avatar, he will be redeemed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.150;A foolish quest for a foolish [From.GetBoyGirl];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.151;The deadline for [From.GetPrincePrincessCap] [From.GetFirstName]'s departure has passed, and apparently the [From.GetBoyGirl] has set sail with the help of your [FromFrom.GetBrotherSister] [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. You hear they search foolishly for the lost Avatar. It's unlikely both will ever return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.151;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s influence may prove troublesome? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.146;[From.GetFatherMother] has decided upon your fate for this interruption. If you are so willing to have a say in your Nation's fate, you will fight for it yourself. Until decided otherwise, your [From.GetFatherMother] has sent you on a mission to find the Avatar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.146;I will not let you down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.147;In your seclusion, you have heard that your [FromFrom.GetBrotherSister], [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to send his own [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName] on a reckless mission as punishment for speaking against  [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. You have lost so many close to you, you cannot bear to see another perish needlessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.147;I will aid [From.GetFirstName] in this journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCHYW.152;The War currently raging through the world is the greatest yet seen, bringing all nations and peoples into the battle. You have your own enemies on the battlefield and emerged not just victorious, but respected by your people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.152;Onward to victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.1;The war is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.2;How dare they address me as such!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.3;We could compromise for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.4;A shameful defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.5;We'll regain our glory in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.6;The march of progress is delayed, but not stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.7;A welcome relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.8;How long can this peace last?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.9;This discovery has interesting military applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.10;Future generations will see this as a necessary act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.11;Everything is burning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.12;Goodbye old friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.13;It's too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.14;We must be ready to attack the Air Nomads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.15;We cannot pass up the opportunity to make gains in the Earth Kingdom too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.16;We live in such troubling times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.17;This is nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.18;The gains will be great;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.19;A peace that is lenient will last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.20;They must be severely punished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.21;We will annex all the land we've taken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.22;The Fire Nation must be dismantled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.23;No, we'll need the Comet's power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.24;Yes, we need to attack now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.25;This action would be, perhaps, necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.26;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.27;Yes, we must join our motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.28;No, we've survived this long on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.29;This is troubling news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.30;This is no doubt good for our Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.31;We must succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.32;They are traitors to their people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.33;Execute them as a warning to all who dare plot treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.34;Execute the leaders, but have the surviving rebels conscripted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.35;What A strange fellow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.36;I've never felt stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.37;I've never seen anything like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.38;Long live the new Firelord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.39;May this tyrant be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.40;Our time has come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.66;A great victory indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.66;Surely, they can't kill every Airbender?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.67;The Air Nation will fall eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.67;A great victory for the Airbenders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhC.67;Our enemy must not destroy who we are as a people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhD.67;Pacifism is a luxury we can no longer afford.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.70;I will ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.71;Very well. Prove your worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.71;No! This is not up for debate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhC.71;Azulon is right. [From.GetFirstName] is no bender and no heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.72;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.73;Let us fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.74;I'll put you in your place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.74;I will not fight my brother!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.75;I cannot tolerate weakness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.76;Your inaction is my victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.77;Prepare for defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.78;Rash and foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.79;This is a victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.80;Sorry, but this my destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.81;If that's how he wants it to be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.82;Just one mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.83;You are unworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.84;You deserve this brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.85;Azulon is my true heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.85;[From.GetFirstName] I have failed you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAh.86;Perhaps now he will understand his place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.88;My kindness compels me to give shelter to this child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.88;We will take her to the nearest village for a Healer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhA.89;You must keep this a secret for all our safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAhB.89;Don't worry, you're safe here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.0;The Earth Kingdom has stood longer than any other nation, sprawling and complex. For too long though, useless bureaucrats and the treacherous Dai Li have wielded the real power. As Earth King, you must reclaim your past power and once again rule the Kingdom as is your birth right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.1;To have any chance of reclaiming royal power, we must establish a secure line of communication with those loyal to the throne. Under the guise of founding a Royal Mail Service, we can secretly deliver messages to allies out of the Dai Li's sight. Of course, this will take time and significant risk of discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.2;Unfortunately, some unknown bureaucrat has made off with a vast sum of money that was to be spent on the establishment of the Royal Mail Service. Our advisors believe the project will be severely hampered unless we can replenish the fund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.3;The Mail Service project has once again hit an impasse. Correspondences have always been delivered by private couriers, and now the wealthy citizens who provide such services argue that we have no business intruding in their market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.4;A terrified courtier has reported to you that a Dai Li agent is coming close to uncovering our clandestine efforts. Discovery of our efforts now will place everything we have accomplished in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.5;We have successfully avoided the Dai Li's attention. For now, we can continue without risk of discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.6;Our efforts have failed. The Dai Li have disappeared certain courtiers, and now, they recommend their majesty take a long vacation after so many months of constant work. In the mean time, it seems the bureaucrats have scrapped the idea of a Royal Mail Service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.7;Have three years of work, the Royal Mail Service is completed. We can now communicate with our generals, officers and supporters out of sight from the Dai Li. This is a significant move in curbing their power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.8;It appears that a certain vassal has not only refused to pay royal tax, but refused our authority altogether. [From.GetFullName] is now a rebel and traitor to the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.9;We have declared our independence from the incompetent Earth King! No doubt some foolish loyalists will attempt to attack on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.10;It appears [From.GetFullName] has refused to pay the Royal Tax, defying the Earth King who has branded them rebels and traitors to the Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.11;Upon your ascension to the throne, it appears the work your predecessor was pursuing has been lost in the transition. These efforts have been lost, or may need to be restarted under your rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.12;A noble whose ancestors had previously rebelled against your rule, has sent an emissary to Ba Sing Se, offering renewed fealty and pledges of allegiance to the Earth Kingdom. It appears [From.GetFullName] wishes to return their territory to the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.13;Ba Sing Se is famous for many things, such as the three impenetrable walls which surround and divide the city. These walls that have protected the Earth Kingdom for as long as they have stood. Lately however, thanks to corruption and fools, they have fallen into a great state of disrepair. Now however, we can finally begin to restore the walls to their former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.14;Many sections of the walls have not been replaced for centuries, and while many believe you shouldn't fix something that isn't broken, our best architects are finding new and inventive ways to strengthen the city's defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.15;One such reason the walls fell into disrepair is the frequent theft of funds meant to pay it's upkeep. Now once again, a large portion of the funds invested towards reinforcing Ba Sing Se's walls has disappeared. The money will clearly have to be replaced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.16;One of our engineers has reported that while working on repairing a section of Ba Sing Se's walls, he discovered that the foundations had seriously decayed. The entire section will have to be demolished and rebuilt, but that will cost a great deal more than we planned to spend. If we don't replace it, it's inevitable it will collapse on it's own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.17;Repair and improvement upon Ba Sing Se's walls has been occurring across all of the city, but the supervisor of this operation in one district has stood out as a particularly talented individual, managing to achieve far more than his less talented peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.18;After years of constant work around the city, our effort to repair the walls has finally come to an end. While many disagreed there was work to be done in the first place, they now believe the city has been greatly rejuvenated by our investment. No matter the economic impact, it is clear that Ba Sing Se's walls are finally again ready to withstand anyone that could dare besiege them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.19;The Royal Palace is our stronghold and seat of power in Ba Sing Se, but it is not truly ours unless we control the men who guard it. Under the guise of creating a new Royal Guard dedicated solely to the Palace's protection, we will cleanse it of untrustworthy sycophants and Dai Li informants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.20;After two years, a new Royal Guard has been assembled. Not only will these fine soldiers prove their worth as your protectors, you have cleansed the Royal Palace's security of men either incompetent or in the Dai Li's pocket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.21;A general sought an audience with you today about your new Royal Guard. He claims that you are placing the Army's most talented soldiers on what amounts to guard duty when they should be on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.22;It has come to your attention that a member of the new Royal Guard may in fact working for the Dai Li. Worse yet, he is a high ranking captain with many connections to Ba Sing Se's nobility. He must be dealt with, but with discretion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.23;The old Royal Guard was more for show than actual duty, but it included a great many old warriors who distinguished themselves on the field of battle. They will have to go, but what fate awaits them after that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.24;We have assembled an elite force from all across the Earth Kingdom. Putting so much expertise in one place has resulted in some interesting results, including learning of new tactics and strategies yet to spread elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.25;Our supporters advise that we finally begin to move against the Dai Li, deploying agents of our own to scout out all their secret outposts and strongholds throughout Ba Sing Se. This will be a painstakingly long and risky process, but we must finally uncover the extent of the Dai Li's power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.26;After a careful year of planning, you believe you have managed to pinpoint the location of the Dai Li's bases throughout Ba Sing Se. When the time comes, this information will be of great use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.27;With great care, our spies have been able to uncover the presence of a Dai Li outpost within Ba Sing Se.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.28;Our spies have uncovered a major Dai Li base within the city, containing a barracks for agents and who knows what else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.29;We have discovered a Dai Li spy within our ranks, GETNAME. Their continued presence is a danger to everything archived thus far, so how shall they be dealt with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.30;Our spies have finally uncovered the Dai Li's headquarters and primary base of operations, all underground. It will prove difficult to remove when the time comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.31;Victory is near, but if we are to seize it, we need allies both within and without Ba Sing Se's walls. The nobility may not lend their support directly, but they may lend us their soldiers and financial support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.32;We have searched for allies to aid our cause as best as we could, but that time is done. Now, we are ready as we'll ever be to strike at the Dai Li and reclaim Ba Sing Se.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.33;It has been suggested that [noble_ally_target.GetBestName] might be sympathetic to our cause, and might just be willing to lend us [noble_ally_target.GetHerHis] support to our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.34;To our shock, it appears [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to write us a personal message! From [From.GetBestName] [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetSheHe] requests our clandestine support of [From.GetHerHis] efforts to overthrow the traitorous Dai Li.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.35;It appears [From.GetBestName] realises where [From.GetHerHis] true loyalties lie, that is with us. When the time comes, [From.GetSheHe] will send us [From.GetHerHis] personal guard to help secure the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.36;It appears [From.GetBestName] is a traitor, choosing to ignore our requests. When the time comes, we will punish [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.37;We will need all the forces possible to ensure victory, so we must look even beyond the city's walls for support of our loyal subjects. Our advisors suggest we should write [tribune_ally_target.GetBestName] for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.38;A rider arrived from Ba Sing Se, carrying a message to you as swiftly as possible. It appears [From.GetHerHis] Majesty, [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to write to you, asking for your support to overthrow the Dai Li in Ba Sing Se!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.41;The time has come to reclaim the rightful powers of the throne. Already, forces loyal to us are spreading out into Ba Sing Se, overrunning any who oppose this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.42;It appears the Grand Secretariat does not plan to give up without a fight, ordering his own men into battle against us. It is time to dispose with this traitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.43;As the chaos subsides, it is clear that with the capture of the Grand Secretariat that the Dai Li have been defeated. All surviving members have either fled the city or surrendered to forces loyal to the Earth King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.44;With the Palace once again under the control of the Grand Secretariat, our bid to retake control of our Kingdom has failed and we are at his mercy. Our supporters have quickly been rounded up and executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.45;With the Grand Secretariat deposed from power, no longer is the Earth King merely a figurehead in his own Kingdom. From now on, a new era of direct rule over Ba Sing Se begins. Perhaps one day, the entire Earth Kingdom will once again be properly united under that rule. For now, however, all that remains is to deal with the surviving Dai Li. We could purge the remains of their organisation and ensure they never again seize power, but in doing so lose their expertise and expansive spy network. Some ministers suggest a new Grand Secretariat should be appointed of their choosing, but ultimately the decision is up to the Earth King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.46;News is spreading of chaos in Ba Sing Se as conflict breaks out between the Dai Li and forces that claim allegiance to the Earth King. While power struggles are nothing new to the impenetrable city, it is clear that this one shall shape the future of the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.47;Word has come that the Earth King has been victorious in Ba Sing Se, overthrowing the Dai Li who ruled the city. This marks a clear shift in power in the Earth Kingdom, and will have many consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCRES.48;It has been said the Dai Li have successfully crushed a wide spread rebellion in Ba Sing Se. It has come to light that a great many of the nobility were involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Earth King, and have all since been executed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.0;I shall restore our glory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.1;This will be a worthwhile effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.2;We will cover the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.3;Hunt down this thief and cut off his hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.4;We can minimize the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.5;Promise them compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.6;They should know better than question their King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.7;Tell them this service is purely for military use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.8;You'd be a useful scapegoat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.9;We can buy his loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.10;Have the agent eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.11;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.12;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.13;I'm sure my loyal subjects can handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.14;They shall be brought to heel again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.15;This is an outrage! They shall be destroyed at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.16;We shall now decide our own fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.17;Perhaps we could retake those lands on our King's behalf...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.18;These walls are a symbol of our strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.19;A fine accomplishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.20;I'm sure my subjects can pay the difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.21;The Royal Treasury will replace the funds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.22;It is clear we have no choice but to replace the wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.23;So what if it collapses?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.24;We need a man like that in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.25;Be sure to reward his diligent work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.26;It was a worthwhile investment to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.27;The Guard should answer only to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.28;Assure him we'll recruit more men to fill the ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.29;Can't he simply find more soldiers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.30;Put him somewhere he can't do much damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.31;Arrange an unfortunate accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.32;I don't care about these old men. Just remove them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.33;They can stay in an advisory position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.34;We'll pay them pensions for their dutiful service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.35;This a good result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.36;This is of vital importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.37;We are one step closer to victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.38;This is the information we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.39;Highly concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.40;Now we know where they hide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.41;We'll need their aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.42;We are ready to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.43;Let's see where [noble_ally_target.GetSheHe] places [noble_ally_target.GetHerHis] loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.44;I will support my King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.45;I cannot risk it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.46;A loyal subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.47;They will pay in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.48;An ally outside the city could be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.49;It is good to have their support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.50;They'll pay for this treachery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.51;The time to take the city back is now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.52;They will dealt with like the traitors they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.53;Victory at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.54;Perhaps it was not to be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.55;The Dai Li shall be disbanded forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.56;Power struggles are hardly anything new...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.57;This is something to remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.58;We'll take note of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.59;No wonder the Earth Kingdom is so weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.60;The Dai Li shall now serve me properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAr.61;Oh no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

TUTORIAL_BENDING;Bending Arts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
TUTORIAL_DESC_3;Certain characters are capable of exhibiting Bending, the ability to manipulate one of four elements: Fire, Air, Water and Earth. These abilities are represented by two traits, one indicating the element and one indicating skill level, which scales from incompetent, competent, powerful, master and legendary. These traits give varying benefits to a character's skills and combat abilities.\nCharacters can only develop the ability to bend an element before they become adults, either having a high chance of inheriting from their parents, or a much smaller chance of randomly developing it. Characters can increase their skill level over their lifetime, through training with another with a higher skill level or through various events. Only a select few will ever become legendary for their ability however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

TUTORIAL_SPIRITS;The Spirit World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
TUTORIAL_DESC_4;Spirits are mystical beings who dwell on another plane known as the Spirit World. Mostly disinterested with Humanity, it is never the less a good idea to gain their favour and avoid their wrath. The Spirit World can be interacted with via the Spirit World menu, which can be accessed at the bottom-right corner of the screen.\nHere, one can interact with the Spirit World, taking certain actions to gain favour in hopes of possibly receiving a boon from the Spirits. Also here, you can view the status of the Spirit's inclination towards Humanity, which can range from peacefulness to hostility, and the current Age, which is discussed on the following page. In addition, whenever the Avatar is active, you will be able to find them here. If not, then at the left side you will find a wise sage who serves as a voice for the Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

TUTORIAL_AGES;The Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
TUTORIAL_DESC_5;Found on the Spirit World menu, you can see the Age the world is currently in. Throughout the game, the world moves throughout thirteen distinct Ages, each with their own rules and effects. Each Age can introduce or remove certain Casus Belli's, affect trade routes and provinces, introduce new units and beliefs. When certain conditions are met, the world will progress to the next Age, these conditions varying from simply reaching a certain year or when a particular event occurs.\n\nThe various Ages listed in order of occurrence are the Ages of Uncertainty, Rebellion, Smoke and Shadow, Prosperity, Aggression, Destruction, Hostility, Devastation, Disharmony, Peace and Progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

TUTORIAL_AVATAR;The Avatar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
TUTORIAL_DESC_6;The Avatar is both Human and Spirit, a cycle of rebirth that has lasted since the dawning of the age and the only being capable of wielding all four elements. When the Avatar dies, they will be reborn according to the cycle of elements, from Earth to Fire, Fire to Air, Air to Water and so on. Once they come of age, they will begin their training to master all four elements and eventually claim their title as Avatar.\nThe Avatar is capable of great things, and is a very powerful combatant. When an Avatar is active, they can also be located in the Spirit World menu, as representative of the Spirits. When dealing with issues relating to the Spirits, summoning the Avatar for assistance can be a great step towards peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

TUTORIAL_EARTH_KINGDOM;The Earth Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
TUTORIAL_DESC_7;The Earth Kingdom is an ancient confederation, ruled from the massive city of Ba Sing Se by the Earth King. The power the Earth King wields over the realm is represented by Royal Authority, a statistic that can be found under the Earth King trait or listed under the current Age's effects. If the Earth King is under the thumb of the royal court, Royal Authority is capped at 75% until this changes. Royal Authority can be changed by various events, decisions and wars, but is otherwise gained depending on the number of vassal and tributaries within the Earth Kingdom every five years. Royal Authority can be spent to use special CB's, diplomatic actions or to change laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

TUTORIAL_COLONIES;Colonies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
TUTORIAL_DESC_8;While you may convert provinces within your cultural and religious group normally, you cannot do so for those outside it. Instead, you can establish a colony to convert a province outside your cultural group. You can do so by clicking on a province's county title, and selecting the colonisation decision, paying the cost to build the colony. When established, a Colony needs to progress through three stages before the province is converted, each stage lessening the negative effects caused by the process. Colonies consume prosperity to grow, thus a province cannot be prosperous while being colonized. If the province is attacked or changes hands, the colony can be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

TUTORIAL_DESC_9;The Air Nomads receive have many distinct features which differ them from other cultures. Separated into four groups, Northern and Southern Air Nomads are purely male, while Eastern and Western are female. Children born into this culture belong the dynasty of their same-sex parent. In addition, Air Nomads are dictated by the Elder Council society, whose four Elders control the laws in Air Nomad realms, and are also capable of granting various modifiers to Air Nomad provinces. The Elder Council makes decisions every five years depending on it's view of the current situation. Controlling any one of four Air Temples enables you to claim a place on the Elder Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTTOOLTIPDELAY;It has not been too long since we were last caught conspiring against the Grand Secretariat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCEK.3;Too young to take your rightful throne in the court's opinion, you will need a regent to rule in your stead. Fortunately, the Grand Secretariat is all too willing to take up that duty and protect your Kingdom in your name...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTEK.3;What a good friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPRES01;You have begun a campaign to reclaim your rightful powers as Earth King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPRES02;You have begun an effort to undermine Dai Li power in Ba Sing Se. This effort will take three years to complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPRES03;You have failed in your efforts to reclaim royal power. The Dai Li will continue to hold sway over the royal court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTTOOLTIPRES08;The troublesome officer is eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCORDER.1;Grand Secretariat [From.GetFullName], made a visit to Palace today, taking formal command of security there. Grand Secretariat [From.GetFirstName] is apparently concerned with your safety and  has offered the service of two of his finest Dai Li agents for your protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTORDERA.1;We welcome the Grand Secretariat?s aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTORDERB.1;He may be Grand Secretariat, but tell him he can keep his agents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
FIRE_REBELLION;Spiritualist Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLA.7001;There are mummers every now and then that not everyone agrees with your actions, much less approves of them. Some would dare even brand your rule inhumane, and there may be some truth to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLA.7002;Your continued rule is continued harsh by some, an atrocity by others. You continued aggression against others peoples, and willingness to take whatever you please, has slowly eroded your reputation in the eyes of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLA.7003;There is no doubt they shall remember your reign, as you have conquered wide and far, expanding the territories of your people to never before seen heights. To them, you may be a hero, to others though, you a conqueror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLA.7004;As your aggression continues and more territories fall under your control, there has been an ever increasing need to stomp down on those foolish enough to defy you. A tyrant you may be, but one of necessity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLA.7005;Your name is whispered by frightened voices, as now all have come to fear your power. Your reputation is so fearsome that even your enemies fear facing you in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLA.7006;You are slowly gaining a reputation at home and abroad with other rulers as a kind and virtuous person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

spiritual_journey_desc;It is time to leave my comfortable abode and to journey to new places. Perhaps a few months travelling with have me return a wiser and much more spiritual ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.1;After careful preparation, both for your realm and your journey, you set out from home with no sure destination in mind. Where you wander may take you far beyond even your native land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.1;I wonder where my travels will take me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.2;After a year travelling the world beyond your realm, you finally are welcomed home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.2;It's good to be home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.3;Watching a local noble's personal militia train from afar, you realise there are a great many different ways of battle beyond your knowledge. Perhaps this experience will serve you well in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.3;Knowing is half the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.4;Travelling far away lands, you've discovered so many new things you simply lack at home. Even the most simple baubles can be made by crafting technique you're own craftsmen are yet to discover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.4;Maybe I can take home a few souvenirs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.5;You know how harsh life can be for those who work the land, but the village you find yourself in is particularly impoverished. A wildfire has destroyed their harvest and likely not all of them will survive to see the next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.5;Perhaps I could give what I have to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.5;I'll need this money on the road ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.6;On your travels, you hear rumour of an ancient temple. After spending many weeks searching, you finally come across it. Though the ruins have long been picked clean, you stumble across one last majestic relic hidden away, clearly of great value and significance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.6;Nobody will miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.6;It is not mine to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.7;Travelling alone can be hard, but it seems recently you've acquired an animal companion to share the journey with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.7;It's always good to have a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLARA.8;In your travels, you have heard of a great bending master who lives nearby. Though this master does not accept just anybody, perhaps this could be the perfect opportunity to improve your own bending talents?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLARB.8;Not being a bender, you sometimes feel at a great disadvantage in battle. Lately however, you've heard of a master of blades who can defeat many benders with ease. Perhaps you too could learn the art of the sword?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.8;I would be grateful to learn from a true master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.8;I do not seek to be more a warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.9;You come across a temple, and after curiosity has you enter, you find no one here will speak to you or speak at all. Frustratingly, you cannot understand anything here on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.9;Clearly, silence is key.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.9;This is clearly some ridiculous charade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.10;You find yourself crossing the desolate Si Wong Desert, the harsh sun bearing down. At first, you believe it a trick of the heat, but you can hear someone begging for help. Stumbling across the sand dunes, this fellow traveller has clearly been lost for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.10;They clearly need water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.10;This might be some kind of bandit trap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLARA.11;Legend has it that dragons still reside on islands not far from the Fire Nation. It might a perilous trip, but it might just be worth it to witness one of the original Firebending masters in action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLARB.11;The legends say that the first Earthbenders learned how to move the soil from the Badgermoles who resided under the Two Lover Mountains. It may be dangerous to seek such a solitary creature, but perhaps it would be worthwhile to find the Badgermoles yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLARC.11;Long have the wisest of the Air Nomads sat in meditation for days to expand their spiritual wisdom. One of the greatest spiritual trials one can face is to open the several Chakras in the body, and become wiser for it. Perhaps you should seek solitude so you can try this yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLARD.11;In the Northern Water Tribe, there are many spiritual places that are close to the Spirit World. Though such things are usually for the Shamans, not Chiefs, perhaps you too could see out one of these places and forge a closer connection with the Spirits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.11;Yes, I shall make the journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.11;No, it will not be worth my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.12;Roaming the northern plains of the Earth Kingdom, you come across an old man meditating. After short conversation, it is clear that he was once more than an elderly traveller, though you can't quite figure out what he's trying to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.12;Always attack?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.12;The best defence is to do nothing at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARC.12;The best offense is defence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.13;Towards the end of the journey, funds are begun to get a bit scarce. Perhaps I could count on the hospitality of a local noble?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.13;Yes, I should pay them a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.13;No, I can afford my own lodging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.14;Wandering the Si Wong Desert, a sandstorm forces you off the well tread path and you quickly become lost with no civilisation in sight. As water becomes scarce, maybe you could survive off the liquid inside the cactus?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.14;Yes, that will quench my thirst?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.14;I'll have to survive on what I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.15;After a week's journey, you happen upon a dragon in the wild. It is clearly a majestic creature, strong and powerful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.15;Perhaps I can learn from it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.15;It is best I keep my distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARC.15;I'll kill it! For the glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.16;After long studying how the dragons bend fire, you have come to a realisation that Firebending is so much more than just destructive power. You appreciate the power of the dragons now more than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.16;This has been a worthwhile experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.17;After days of watching the dragons from afar, you still cannot glean anything. As your supplies dwindle, it is clear you will have to begin the journey home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.17;They're just overgrown lizards in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.18;After a fierce battle with the Dragon, you barely make it out alive. You end up crawling all the way to a nearby village, who thankfully stem the bleeding before your wounds kill you. It's clear that you are no match for a dragon's power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.18;I'll kill that beast one day, I swear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.19;After a long tiring battle lasting days, you finally deliver the deathblow to the Dragon with a spear. You cut a scale from the beast's head so that no one can ever question your achievement here today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.19;I am [Root.GetFirstName], slayer of dragons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.20;After a week of searching, you find a Badgermole in some caves. It is clearly capable of tearing through solid rock like sand, unbelievably powerful. You watch it scurry through the darkness, blind by sight but navigating by some unseen power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.20;I must study how it Earthbends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.20;Though not an Earthbender, I can still learn from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARC.20;It's just a giant furry beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.21;After days of watching the Badgermoles, you believe they navigate by sending tremors through the earth. After many blindfolded trials, you believe you've discovered the same ability, using your Earthbending to truly feel the world around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.21;What an amazing ability!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.22;Meditating atop a mountain, you focus, going through the motions to unlock the several chakras in your body: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Sound, Light and Thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.22;I must focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.22;Maybe this was the wrong idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.23;You attempt to unblock the chakras in your body, but you are unable to overcome them. Clearly, without help, you are unable to achieve this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.23;Perhaps my faults are my nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.24;One by one, you unblock your chakras, casting aside your fear, guilt, shame and grief, overcome the lies and illusions and let go of your earthly attachments. You now feel more spiritually in-tune with the world than ever, almost like you've only now opened your eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.24;I must continue meditation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.25;Sitting atop the mountain in meditation for a week now, you finally are ready to descend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.25;I feel enlightened by this experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.26;You've finally reached the main stretch of your journey north, and now you'll be on your own. From here to the Oasis, there's nothing but desolate tundra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.26;I must press on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.26;This journey is clearly too dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.27;You end up lost on the tundra, and soon you hear wolves howling at the wind. Every moment you spend out here in the freezing cold is dangerous, and you are already a week behind where you need to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.27;A few wolves won't stop me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.27;I have no choice but to turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.28;You finally arrive at the Oasis, a small forest in the middle of desolate tundra. Whatever keeps this place alive is clearly Spiritual in nature, and you feel a strange sensation, an awe the likes you've never felt before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.28;Perhaps I should meditate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.29;After a moment of meditation, you enter the Spirit World. You open your eyes to reveal a strange place unlike you've ever seen before. It's so full of beauty and wonder, you cannot help but wonder why anyone would ever doubt the Spirits. Soon though, you return to the physical world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.29;I must return home, but I'll never forget this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.30;After a moment of meditation, you enter the Spirit World. You open your eyes to reveal a strange place unlike you've ever seen before. You hear a strange scratching, like something is closing in. You turn, but it's too late. Waking up, the Spirit World is gone and you feel? stranger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.30;It's was just a dream. Time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.31;Lately, a traveller has arrived, [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks if you'd be willing to provide them shelter for a night before [From.GetSheHe] continues their journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.31;An Air Nomad never turns away a guest in need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.31;Of course they can stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARC.31;No, turn them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.32;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gladly welcomes you to [From.GetHerHis] home, providing you with both a meal and shelter. You feel greatly welcomed as you talk at length with your hosts about your homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.32;Their generosity is most appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.32;It's a reception fitting of someone of my station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.33;It appears, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to turn you away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.33;This is greatly displeasing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.34;[From.GetFirstName] proves to be an interesting guest, talking at length about [From.GetHerHis] home and [From.GetHerHis] travels around the world. The next morning, they depart to continue their journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.34;They are always welcome to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.35;[From.GetFirstName] proves to be an interesting guest, but is a touch arrogant, boosting about [From.GetHerHis] travels and [From.GetHerHis] own land. They depart the next morning, going on their way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLAR.35;I guess that was one way to pass the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.50;Our tribe are not the only ones who survive by hunting in these lands. Now though, a great many wolves seem to be gathering dangerously close to our settlement. They'll prove to be a great menace to our people until they either disperse or they're destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.50;As Chief, it is my duty to protect the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.50;We can wait them out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.51;Today, a traveller arrived at our village, claiming to hail from one of the Northern Tribes. She claims to be an orphan in search of a new home, and offers us her skills as a Healer. So far, the village has welcomed her, but whether or not she stays is up to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.51;Of course she can stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.51;We do not take in outsiders, no matter what they offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.52;You're hunting not far from home, among the snowdrift, when you hear a dreadful growl. Not far from you, camouflaged from sight, is a full grown Polar Bear Dog, one of the greatest danger any hunter could ever face. While no hunter of men, they are notoriously territorial and this one is dangerously close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.52;I'll slay the beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.52;I'll play dead and let it pass me by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.53;Recently, we've been visited by traders from the distant Earth Kingdom. They seek to exchange their goods for Furs and Pelts. While they offer fair enough prices, it is not our ways to become dependent on these outsiders and their trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.53;We can enjoy a little luxury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.53;They can take their baubles and leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.201;News has reached the court that the province is being terrorized by a gang of Firebenders who've been robbing travellers and extorting farmers. Clearly, a solution is needed to put a stop to this menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.201;The guard will put an end to these bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.201;The weak deserve no protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARC.201;Time to crack down on all these unruly Firebenders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.202;Forest fires are inevitable this time of year, and it appears some stupid farmer's attempt to clear land as gone wrong. Now, this fire threatens not only the outlying villages in the province, but a great many lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.202;We'll hire as many Firebenders as possible to stop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.202;You can't stop a fire, and I don't care to try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARC.202;It's of no concern, I'll deal with it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCATLAR.203;For hours, the ground in [Root.Capital.GetName] rumbled. Finally, smoke has begin to bellow from the nearby mountains. We are no strangers to the fiery wrath of a volcano, but as rolling waves of lava begin to flow, terror and chaos soon follow. As the devastation approaches, the court waits upon your word on what shall be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARA.203;We will build ditches and stand our ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARB.203;People must evacuated from this destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARC.203;I will save myself and treasury!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAATLARD.203;Oh, Spirits have mercy upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARAA.203;[Root.GetFirstName] perishing in the effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARAB.203;[Root.GetFirstName] is proven a brave ruler, saving the province from devastation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARBA.203;[Root.GetFirstName] does not escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARBB.203;not everyone escapes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARBC.203;everyone escapes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARdesc.300;Today, your courtiers have little to report. Little has happened lately save for the arrival of a peculiar travelling merchant from far away, arriving only with a cart of cabbages. The man must be a genius trader or the most desperate soul to travel so far to sell only vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptA.300;Perhaps we could use a merchant's advice at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptB.300;What a boring day this is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptC.300;Have the guard seize these cabbages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARAA.300;a true cabbage merchant you find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARAB.300;a poor trader of vegetables you find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLARAC.300;My cabbages!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARdesc.301;It seems your instinct regarding the merchant was correct, with the man proving himself a genius in the economics of trade and agriculture. Still, for all this expertise, he shall still forever be known to the court as the 'Cabbage Man'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARdesc.302;A week after hiring the man, the prattling cabbage merchant has proven to be completely incompetent at the most basic tenants of court etiquette. While some of the court are amused, for most, the fool has become a nuisance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptA.301;I was lucky to find such an expert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptA.302;I think the fool is funny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptB.302;Very well, throw him over the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARtitle.304;Death of a Cabbage Salesman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARdesc.304;Today, your courtiers bring you news that your courtier, Gao 'The Cabbage Man' Gan-Lan is no longer among the living. Known for his love of cabbages and great expertise in the fields of trade and agriculture, the former cabbage merchant shall be fondly remembered amongst the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptA.304;Who?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptB.304;I will miss his wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARdesc.500;Quite unexpectedly, an elderly traveller has appeared at your court. Presenting himself as a noble and a scholar from a distant land, he presents what he labels a simple proposal. In exchange for turning a blind eye to any 'problems' that might arise from his research during his visit, he will reimburse you generously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptA.500;This sounds like easy money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptB.500;Get out of my home and never return, you warlock!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
peasant_unrest_and_hysteria;The populace is furious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARdesc.502;Despite the guards best effort, the old traveller appears to have escaped into the night. What exactly he planned, and what happened to his victims, shall probably never be known. Still, the manhunt appears to have thankfully put the populace at ease and prevented hysteria. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptA.502;Maybe I made a mistake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptB.502;I must cleanse myself of this dirty money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARdesc.503;The mysterious traveller appears before you again. Apparently, his work is done and he bids you farewell as he leaves for his next destination. Before he goes however, he offers you another generous gift for you aid?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLARoptA.503;Perhaps we can do business another time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_WATERTRIBE_TITLE;The Water Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_WATERTRIBE_SOUTH;It is a time of peace for the Water Tribes, who have long lived far from the other nations, protected by their isolation and the harsh, unforgiving terrain of their homeland. From the great northern city, the Chief of the North is said to be ruler of all Water Tribe, but that authority has always been tempered with a great deal of independence of the many chieftains and tribes. As turmoil continues to grip the other nations, the Water Tribe remains untouched.\n\nAs a chief in the Southern Water Tribe, you could care less for the world's concerns. Life in the south is good, peaceful and prosperous as these unforgiving frozen lands can be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_WATERTRIBE_NORTH;It is a time of peace for the Water Tribes, who have long lived far from the other nations, protected by their isolation and the harsh, unforgiving terrain of their homeland. From the great northern city, the Chief of the North is said to be ruler of all Water Tribe, but that authority has always been tempered with a great deal of independence of the many chieftains and tribes. As turmoil continues to grip the other nations, the Water Tribe remains untouched.\n\nAs a chief of the Northern Water Tribe, the outside world's affairs are of little interest. The great Moon and Ocean Spirits continue their eternal dance in the Spirit Oasis, and there is great harmony between Man and Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_WATERTRIBE;It is a time of peace for the Water Tribes, who have long lived far from the other nations, protected by their isolation and the harsh, unforgiving terrain of their homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_EARTHKINGDOM_TITLE;The Earth Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_EARTHKINGDOM;For generations, the innumerable tribes and realms scattered across the continent have pledged fealty to the Earth King in Ba Sing Se. The once mighty Earth Kingdom of centuries past though has faded away, with the Earth King's presence beyond the towering walls of Ba Sing Se growing weaker by the day. While this lack of authority has left the Kingdom's many subjects to fend for themselves, the vassal kings, the lords and chieftains have long taken advantage of the capital's waning power to war and expand their territories. Whether the future brings further decay, or perhaps a reawakening of this once powerful nation, remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_BASINGSE_TITLE;Ba Sing Se;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_BASINGSE;The impenetrable city, heart and jewel of the Earth Kingdom. For untold centuries, the Earth King has ruled from his throne from the Royal Palace at the very heart of the city. Surrounded by towering walls and guarded by elite warriors, Ba Sing Se has never fallen to any enemy who dares besieges it. While unassailable on the outside, the real dangers dwell within. From the poverty of the Outer Ring, to the scheming nobility much closer to the throne, and worst of all, the all seeing Dai Li who rule the city from the shadows, Ba Sing Se is a dangerous and decrepit place. One wonders whether it is destined to be consumed by it's own corruption and decadence, or if one can hope it can once be restored to the glory and splendor of the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_FIRENATION_TITLE;The Fire Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ATLA_INTRO_FIRENATION;Once, the grand civilisation of the Sun Warriors ruled over the Fire Islands. That time of old has passed, with their mighty empire fading away. Since then, our people have come to rule these prosperous lands. While the harsh climate and ever present threat of volcanic eruption may seem unbearable to less hardened folk, it is the forge in which our people have grown stronger. No matter the future, no matter who rules, the people of Agni will endure, as they always have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTINTRO.1;The Spirits bless us with such fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTINTRO.2;In such times, it is upon our own strength which we must rely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax;The Common Tax;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
commoner_tax_desc;While the realm itself greatly depends on the income derived from our many provinces, it is the taxes themselves on the common people that truly have the most impact. Generously low taxes may help growth, prosperity and lower rebelliousness may however anger aristocrats and deal a significant blow to the economy. Likewise, harsh taxes may be extremely profitable, may lead to mass rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_0;Generous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_0_desc;The contributions expected of the common folk to the state itself are trivially low. While this means there is far less income to be made, the result is a happier, more docile provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_1;Lenient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_1_desc;The contribution subjects are expected to make is far less than what is taken in neighbouring regions, leading to a less burdened and slightly more grateful, populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_2;Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_2_desc;The contributions expected of subjects is fairly standard, neither too harsh, but not what anyone would describe as low. Overall, it is the price paid by many folk, so not many see reason to complain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_3;Tough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_3_desc;The contributions expected of the populace are fairly tough compared to elsewhere, with taxes depleting the wealth of the common folk. Many grumble against such levies, but keep their heads down none the less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_4;Harsh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_4_desc;The taxes enforced upon the common folk are harsh, with many barely scraping by. While the realm accumulates great wealth from this, anger and dissent amongst the populace is growing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_5;Brutal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
commoner_tax_5_desc;The taxes levied on the populace are brutal, with everything from coins to crops being seized by the state. Many starve, and the people are furious at this injustice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCTLA.4016;The Firelord has seen fit to expand into our territory, and with no Avatar to confront this act of aggression, I am left with no choice but to address this matter myself. As Earth King, I will demand the Firelord leave my lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTTLAA.4016;Or face dire consequences!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCTLA.4017;After conquering Earth Kingdom lands with little resistance, the Earth King has finally seen fit to write us a sternly worded letter! The fool demands we give up our colonies, or face hollow threats of retaliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTTLAA.4017;Send my reply. No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCTLA.4018;After our threat, the Firelord has seen fit to simply laugh us off. This insult cannot go unpunished! We must prepare for the reality of war with these Fire tossing scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTTLAA.4018;These conquests will end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTITLETLA.4019;End of Prosperity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCTLA.4019;With the recent confrontation over the Colonies over, the era of prosperity that began not that long ago is swiftly coming to an end. Merchants from the Fire Isles are becoming less and less welcome abroad, and trade is slowly grinding to a halt, bringing hardship everywhere. Meanwhile, the Fire Nation continues to build it's military strength regardless, and the storm clouds begin to gather for future conflict. Who knows what upheaval this new era will bring?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTTLAA.4019;Onward, to future glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTTLAB.4019;What dark times?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
