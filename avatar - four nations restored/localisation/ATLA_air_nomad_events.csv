NOMADEVTDESC15;Now that I am an adult, I may have to uphold our traditions and our nomadic way of life, but I am also now free to live it as I wish. Perhaps now is my chance to wander the world on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.15;I will go!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.15;No, I am needed here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC204A;While it is true that I have strayed from my old beliefs, the Council of Elders has now chosen to make the decision to expel me from their number for that very reason..;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC204B;It appears that [Root.GetFirstName] has strayed from our beliefs, choosing the path of ignorance instead of our people's sacred traditions. For that reason, [Root.GetSheHe] is expelled from the Council of Elders, no longer one of us..;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.204;Leave them to their bickering.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.204;Perhaps one day [Root.GetSheHe] may regret such choices...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCA401;After coming of age, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has come and stated [From.GetHerHis] desire to embrace our people's nomadic nature and journey abroad. While ultimately [From.GetSheHe] is set on going, you have the final say in the matter.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCB401;After coming of age, the young pupil [From.GetFirstName] has stated [From.GetHerHis] intention to leave the Temple and embrace our people's nomadic traditions by travelling abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.401;I hope [From.GetSheHe] has safe travels.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.401;No, I forbid it, [From.GetSheHe] is needed here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCA402;After coming of age, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to shun tradition and has not decided to depart the temple, instead choosing to stay and busy [From.GetHerselfHimself] in [From.GetHerHis] usual work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCB402;After many weeks, it has become clear that young pupil, [From.GetFirstName] has decided not to follow tradition, choosing to remain at the temple instead of being a true nomad, busying [From.GetHerselfHimself] in [From.GetSheHe] usual work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.402;I will not allow it. [From.GetFirstName] should go and live.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.402;Very well, such a journey isn't for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC408;Recently, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has written home, concerning [From.GetHerHis] travels. Apparently, [From.GetFirstName] has made a very close companion with a fellow traveller. From the sounds of it, it appears this [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is becoming very close to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.408;I'm happy [From.GetSheHe] has found companionship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.408;I should tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] love is misplaced.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCA410;After a long journey, my [GetFromRelation] has finally returned home. For [From.GetHerHis] travels, [From.GetFirstName] is clearly a wiser soul, having experienced the wider world and it's joys.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCB410;After a long journey, [From.GetFirstName] has returned to the Temple from which [From.GetSheHe] was born. Clearly, [From.GetHerHis] travels have given [From.GetHerHim] insight into the wider world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.410;I'm glad you have returned to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC412;Many guests pass through every now and then, but a particularly interesting traveller seems to have caught the eyes of your courtiers, an Air Nomad by the name of [From.GetFullName].[From.GetSheHeCap] hails from the distant Air Temples, speaks of strange philosophy and wows many with [From.GetHerHis] Airbending abilities. Perhaps this traveller should be invited as a guest of your court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.412;It would be interesting to meet one of these Nomads.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.412;Bah, I have no time for vagrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADC.412;Sadly, I'm busy at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC601;As appointed leader of one of the four Air Temples, it is only fair that you sit on the Elder Council and have a voice in matters that concern all Air Nomads.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.601;I appreciate this honour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC602;With one seat on the Elder Council empty, a new representative from that Air Temple has risen up to take it, [From.GetFullName]. The rest of the Council must wait and see if their voice is one of wisdom or one of disputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.602;We shall see;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC603;You have decided to begin you search for one worthy enough to take your place. Over the coming weeks, you will observe many of the Temple's best, in hopes of finding one capable enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.603;I will find someone in the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.603;I will choose someone from my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADC.603;I trust in the choice of the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADD.603;I have changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
choose_family_tt;I can choose someone from my §YFamily§!, but then I will have §Yto convince§! §YThe Council§! to choose [Root.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;x
choose_council_nominee_tt;§YThe Council§! elects the best within us, so why shouldn't I trust them? By choosing this, you will §Yadopt§! the council nominee into your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
choose_random_tt;I will walk around the temple and find someone in the meditation room. By choosing this, you will see several §Rrandom§! people, from young disciples to masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC501;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFullName] has accepted my offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTOPTA.501;Yes, [From.GetSheHe] is ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTOPTB.501;No, [From.GetSheHe] is too young;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC502;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFullName] said [From.GetSheHe] isn't ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTOPTA.502;Yes, [From.GetSheHe] is too young.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC503;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFullName] said [From.GetSheHe] is on journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTOPTA.503;Yes, [From.GetSheHe] needs to see the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTOPTB.503;No, return [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC504;[From.GetFromRelation] [From.GetFullName] sent me a messenger with a letter. The letter says I must urgently return back to [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTOPT.504;They need me at home...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC511;I've found a successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC512;I've found no successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTOPTA.512;I will not give up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC551;Our [From.GetBrotherSisterCap] [From.GetFirstName] now is the master of airbending. [From.GetSheHeCap] deserves to get [From.GetHersHis] tattoos as the sign of the mastery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMAD.551;[From.GetSheHeCap] is now equal to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606A;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is a talented speaker and mediator, and well travelled beyond the Air Temples. Surely, a charismatic individual such as [From.GetFirstName] may prove a worthy leader one day?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606B;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is an Airbender without peer among [From.GetHerHis] generation and has demonstrated [From.GetHerHis] abilities far and wide. In these times, perhaps a more capable leader is what we may one day require.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606C;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is well renown as an organiser and one well versed in trade with outsiders. It is perhaps the Temple could benefit if led by such a keen custodian one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606D;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] isn't very social amongst [From.GetHerHis] peers, but always has a way of getting what [From.GetSheHe] wants. With proper guidance, it is perhaps [From.GetFirstName] may shape up into a proper leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606E;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is very knowledgeable about many things, both within and beyond the Temples, and has a clear talent for the Spiritual. [From.GetFirstName] definitely has the potential to be a great guide for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.606;[From.GetFirstName] is the right choice and a worthy successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.606;No, I must continue my search for another.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADC.606;This search has proven fruitless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bad_search_tt;I will try again from the start.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opinion_adopted_as_successor;Adopted me as a Successor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opinion_adopted_as_a_successor;Appointed Successor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
end_search_for_successor_tooltip;You will adopt §Y[From.GetFirstName]§! as your heir and successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC607;You have sent your messengers far and wide to all other Temples, summoning their leaders to a Council meeting. Even as the most fast speeds, it will take some time until they all arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.607;We have much to discuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC608;After weeks of preparation, all Elders of the Council has arrived and assembled. As the one who first called the meeting, it should be up to you to decide what the first point of discussion should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC609;It appears that [From.GetFullName] has decided that the time has come again for a meeting of Elders from all Air Temples. It will take a few weeks to prepare, but surely, you'll be ready to attend this meeting of the Elder Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.609;I will definitely be there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.608;We must stand firmer against all threats!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.608;We must withdraw ourselves more from the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADD.608;We must embrace our pacifistic traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADE.608;We must turn to a more pragmatic approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADF.608;We must better our trade with the wider world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADC.608;We must curtail trade to better protect ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC610;Weeks later, all members of the Council have assembled at [From.GetFullName]'s request. The meeting is prepared to begin, and as always, as the one who called the meeting, [From.GetFullName] will choose the first point of discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.610;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_aggression;We will start a vote to make our stance towards outsiders more pragmatic, loosening our code of pacifism in order to combat the severe threats we face. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. If the world is stable and trouble isn't apparent, we will have a difficult time convincing the Council to shift it's stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_isolation;We will start a vote to withdraw further from the outside world, avoiding conflict and even isolating ourselves from outsiders. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. If it is apparent that there are threats we cannot ignore, we will have a difficult time convincing the Council to shift it's stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_pacifism;We will start a vote to further promote our pacifistic ideals, shunning conflict and violence. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Naturally, Pacifistic Elders will favour this, while those who subscribe to other ideologies will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_nihilism;We will start a vote to embrace alternative ideologies, exploring our very small place in the world. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Naturally, Nihilistic Elders will favour this, while those who subscribe to other ideologies will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_trade;We will start a vote to again commit to trading with outsiders, bringing in many useful goods but also opening ourselves to outside threats. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Certain Councillors may favour this, while others might argue for a more distant approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_protection;We will start a vote to close ourselves off from trading with outsiders, cutting the Temples off from foreign diseases and threats. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Certain Councillors may favour this, while others might argue for a more economical approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC611;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the increasing danger in the world, particularly that posed by outside threats. [From.GetFullName] argues that some of our most sacred customs must be relaxed in order to ensure continued peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.611;I agree, action must be taken!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.611;I believe we must remain true to our ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_aggression;We will vote §Yyes§! to relaxing pacifistic traditions and embracing a more pragmatic policy. This will enable us to take more decisive action in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_aggression;We will vote §Yno§! to abandoning our pacifistic traditions, preferring to maintain the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC612A;It appears that the Council has agreed with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to embrace a more pragmatic approach when dealing with outside threats. Our customs will change to adapt with these trying times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC612B;It appears that the Council does not agree with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to maintain the status quo. It appears we will remain stagnant and still even in the face of great danger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.612;This will protect us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.612;The Council has made a serious mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_aggression;The vote passes with [global_cp_aggression_vote.GetValue]! votes. The vote to move towards more aggressive policy has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_aggression;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_aggression_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to move towards more aggressive policy has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC613;With [From.GetFullName] having said [From.GetHerHis] part, you now have a chance yourself to speak on an issue of your own choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADG.608;There is nothing I wish to discuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC616;With all matters of contention spoken and concluded, the time has come for the Council to part ways once again. All other members of the Council bid you farewell, thanking you for hosting this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.616;Hopefully we shall all meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC617;All matters before the Council appear to be settled for now, and the time has come to return home. All members of the Council thank [From.GetFullName] gratefully for hosting this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.617;I bid you all farewell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC618;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the need for us Air Nomads to continue to protect our way of life and most valued traditions by withdrawing further from the world and conflict. By isolating ourselves, we avoid conflict with other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.618;I agree, we must abandon conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.618;I believe our current policy is best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC619A;It appears that the Council has agreed with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to isolate ourselves further. This will lead to greater peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC619B;It appears that the Council does not agree with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to maintain the status quo. It appears they are quite content with the inherent risks of dealing with outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.619;This protects our most sacred beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.619;We've sacrificed our ideals today. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_isolation;We will vote §Yyes§! to isolating ourselves further, for our own good. This action will help our people stabilise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_isolation;We will vote §Yno§! to isolating ourselves from the wider world, preferring to maintain the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_isolation;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_isolation_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to distance ourselves from the other nations has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_isolation;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_isolation_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to move towards a more isolationist policy has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC620;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the everlasting philosophical debate concerning the very principles our people are built upon and have cherished for countless generations. [From.GetFullName] argues we don't that these ideals seriously enough, and that we should further embrace and hold to our Pacifistic ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.620;We are in agreement with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.620;No, I feel we do those ideals service enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC621A;The Council has agreed that our Pacifistic ideals must be further embraced, and have chosen to continue to take new action to promote and uphold our most sacred traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC621B;The Council seems to have not agreed, choosing to do nothing to counter the erosion of our most sacred traditions. It seems they are content to sit idle for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.621;I'm glad the Council sees my wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.621;They may idle, but I will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_pacifism;We will vote §Yyes§! to further entrenching Pacifist ideals across Air Nomad lands, countering alternative philosophies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_pacifism;We will vote §Yno§! to any further spread of Pacifistic ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_pacifism;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_pacifism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread the wisdom of Pacifism has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_pacifism;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_pacifism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread Pacifistic ideals has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC622;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council,  and that is the lack of alternative philosophies, particularly those who imagine a different way of thinking that our more traditional approach. [From.GetFullName] argues we should continue to promote this school of thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.622;We will choose to promote these alternative ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.622;No, we shall never promote this alternative, Nihilistic approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC623A;The Council has agreed that alternative viewpoints need to be embraced, giving us the freedom to further spread our wisdom. More and more everyday see the truth in our ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC623B;The Council has remained stubborn, refusing to give space to alternative view points, intent on remaining close-minded and grasping onto the comforting ideals of tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.623;It is most excellent they agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.623;The fools are simply close-minded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_nihilism;We will vote §Yyes§! to further embracing alternative, more pragmatic philosophies, spreading these ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_nihilism;We will vote §Yno§! to abandoning sacred tradition to promote these foolish, Nihilistic ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_nihilism;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_nihilism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread the knowledge of Nihilism has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_nihilism;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_nihilism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread the knowledge of Nihilism has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC624;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, that being the continued trade between our people and other nations. [From.GetFullName] believes we could further promote this, bringing more outsider traders and merchant to our shores. They believe it will improve trade, but others point out it may bring other outsider ills to our homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.624;More trade will benefit us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.624;I do not think it wise to further trade with outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC625A;The Council is in agreement that more trade will be better for all peoples, Air Nomad and outsiders alike. With this motion, more traders and merchants will be able to visit our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC625B;The Council has decided to disagree with the idea of further embracing trade, deciding that the ills of outsiders are too great to be allowed in close proximity of our homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.625;It is good we all see the good outcomes of trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.625;Our lives could all be so much better if they weren§t so foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_trade;We will vote §Yyes§! to promoting trade between ourselves and the outside world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_trade;We will vote §Yno§! to opening ourselves to risk by allowing outsiders unnecessarily close.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_trade;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_trade_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to promote trade and further enrich our lives has succeeded. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_trade;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_trade_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to promote trade has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC626;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the trade between our Temples and outsiders, particularly how it leaves us vulnerable to outsider disease and ills. The suggestion is that we further clamp down on trade, better protecting us even if it means closing ourselves off.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.626;I agree, we must choose safety over comfort.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.626;I disagree, we need trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC627A;The Council have agreed with your stance, and have passed a motion to cease all trade with outsiders merchants. This will further protect our Temples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC627B;The Council does not agree with your line of thought, choosing to continue trading with outsiders and ignoring the dangers it brings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.627;This is no doubt the wise course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.627;They have left us vulnerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_protection;We will vote §Yyes§! to restricting trade between our Temples and the outside world, protecting us from harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_protection;We will vote §Yno§! to closing down trade with the outside world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_protection;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_protection_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to protect our Temples against outsiders and their ills has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_protection;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_protection_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to close ourselves off from trade with outsiders has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC628A;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided to take a more pragmatic approach to dealing with issues, adopting a new, more aggressive stances towards anything that might threaten the Air Temples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC628B;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided against taking a more pragmatic approach to dealing with issues, deciding to maintain the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.628;This is what the Council deems wise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.628;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC629A;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided to move more towards avoiding interference with outsiders, choosing to further our isolation from the wider world, holding true to our Pacifistic traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC629B;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided against shifting our stances towards outsiders, refusing to isolate the Air Nomads further from the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.629;If the Council deems it wise, then that is what we shall do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.629;We will continue on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC630A;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided to further promote and enshrine our sacred traditions of pacifism, countering any alternative schools of thought that might be spreading through the Air Temples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC630B;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided against further promoting of the sacred traditions of pacifism, feeling we Air Nomads honour those ideas already enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.630;The Council chooses tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.630;The Council thinks things fine as they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC631A;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided to embrace and promote alternative schools of thought, in the name of freedom, introducing ideas different than our more traditional ideal of pacifism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC631B;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided against the idea of promoting alternative schools of thought than our more traditional, Pacifistic views, feeling we must stay true to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.631;The Council seems to peruse alternative views.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.631;Things will stay as they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC632A;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided to promote and encourage trade between the Air Temples and outsider merchant and traders. This will hopefully bring many benefits to us, especially our coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC632B;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided against the idea of further promoting trade between the Air Temples and the outside world, feeling it opens us to too great a many risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.632;The coffers will benefit from this decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.632;The Council perhaps see no need for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC633A;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided to take action against trade between the Air Temples and outsiders, saying it brings too many ills into our peaceful communities. Hence forth, such trade will be discouraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC633B;In the most recent meeting of the Elder Council of Air Nomads, and the majority of Elders have decided against taking action against outsider trade, feeling the current arrangement is ideal enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.633;We never needed trade with outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.633;At least this won't hurt our coffers...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
