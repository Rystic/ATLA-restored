EVTDESC_MNM_4454;After Hours of meditation you stare into the pool and see the two fish swimming in perfect balance. Push and Pull. Life and Death. Tui and La. You understand...Chi...It's the lifeforce that rules everything. You can control chi and heal people.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPT_MNHHN_4454;You can control chi and heal people.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
MNHHN_4454_TITLE;You visit the Spirit Oasis;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_5064;It seems [From.GetFullName] has taken a special interest in the study of Chi Paths and Healing, personally attending your practices to get pointers.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPTA_MNHHN_5064;Overall, you feel they have learned a great deal from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_5065;You've taken the opportunity to get healing lessons from [From.GetFullName], just between the two of you, and you are happy with the results. You've made noticeable progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPTA_MNHHN_5065;The results are impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_5061;To my esteemed [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have seen your waterbending skills in action, and wondered of your potential. You could learn so much more, if you simply joined the Healing Hut Society. If you don't, I fear you'd be squandering your potential.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPTA_MNHHN_5061;Of course I'll join.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPTB_MNHHN_5061;I think I'm alright on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_5062;To my esteemed [Root.GetFirstName],\nI'm happy to accept your invitation to join the Healing Hut. I look forward to proving myself worthy of the honour..\n\nSigned, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNHHN_5062;A wise decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_5063;To my esteemed [Root.GetFirstName],\nI'm afraid I'm going to have to decline your offer to join the Healing Hut. I'm just too busy at the moment with other, more important, matters.\n\nSigned, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPTA_MNHHN_5063;A foolish choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_5072;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI write to you in concern for our glorious organisation. I feel we are severely lacking in new blood, and I feel you can help in this regard. Thus, I task you will bringing a new novice into the fold.\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_6000;After long and hard thought, you decided that you wanted to keep [From.GetFullName] safe. You used the water from the Spirit Oasis to heal them. It's said to have special properties. Somehow you know [From.GetFirstName] will live a healthier life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPTA_MNHHN_6000;May [From.GetFullName] live a long life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTDESC_MNHHN_6001;[From.GetFullName] pulled you aside to offer you a special healing session. The water [From.GetFullName] used looked different and afterwards you felt full of life, like you were ready to look for a polarbear dog in the snow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
EVTOPTA_MNHHN_6001;I feel great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
