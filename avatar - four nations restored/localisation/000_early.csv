EVTNAMEEK.62;Territorial Law;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.62;The Earth Kingdom has restructured its laws, changing the obligations between the various lords, petty kings and chieftains to Ba Sing Se's supreme monarch, the Earth [From.GetKingQueen]. Under these laws, these subjects will continue to rule their territories independently, with no obligation to support the Royal Army and likewise, no obligation from Ba Sing Se to protect them. As far as the Royal Court is concerned, the nobility may fight amongst itself all they like, so long as they continue to pay their taxes to the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_62;A new day for the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_62;This new order may benefit us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_62;Interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_62_TOOLTIP;All the various subjects of the Earth Kingdom that have sworn fealty to you are bound under the Territory laws. They may fight amongst themselves as they please, and you can utilise Royal Authority to influence the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_62B_TOOLTIP;You are now bound under the Territory laws. You and your liege cannot call each other to arms, you must pay a small Royal Tax, and can war with other Territories as you please.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEEK.63;Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.63;The ancient laws of the Earth Kingdom have been rewritten by its monarch, Earth [From.GetKingQueen] [From.GetFirstName]. Under these new laws, the ruler of Ba Sing Se and the various lords, petty kings and chieftains of the Earth Kingdom have new obligations to each other. While the nobilities rights remain intact for now, the Earth [From.GetKingQueen] has not just raised the Royal Tax, but acquired new powers allowing for these subjects to brought more firmly under royal control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_63;I will long be remembered for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_63_TOOLTIP;All the various subjects of the Earth Kingdom that have sworn fealty to you are bound under the State Laws. You can call willing subjects to aid you, and protect them from outside enemies. In addition, new ways to exercise Royal Authority have become available, such as the ability to diplomatically annex a subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_63;These changes are frighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_63B_TOOLTIP;You are now bound under the State laws. You pay a higher Royal Tax, and can call your liege to protect you from outside attacks. In addition, you may also in turn be called by your liege to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_63;This no doubt strengthens the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEEK.64;Monarchism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.64;The day has come when the Earth [From.GetKingQueen] has chosen to bring about a final reform upon the Earth Kingdom, sweeping aside the last tatters of the treaty signed in the aftermath of the Ba Sing Se Rebellion. There is now no obstacles between the Earth [From.GetKingQueen] and establishing absolute rule over the entire Earth Kingdom, nor is there from the supreme monarch from restoring the ways of Monarchism and the Royal Cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_64;My power is now absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTC_EK_64_TOOLTIP;With this final reform, you may now restore Earth Monarchism and as monarch of the Earth Kingdom, demand your subjects pledge you their absolute allegiance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_64;We trust our great monarch...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_64;A startling turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.4;For the past few months, banditry is becoming more and more common on our roads. Most of the time, the bandits flee into neighbouring territories and beyond our reach before any response can be mustered. This is clearly not a local issue, and the responsibility of [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_4;I will write the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_4;We will have to endure this difficulty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_4;We clearly just won't have to get caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_4_TOOLTIP;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] will write a letter to [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName], demanding action from Ba Sing Se.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_4_TOOLTIP;The issue will go ignored for now, causing much damage. The court will greatly disapprove.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_4_TOOLTIP;A small and discrete group of our best guardsmen will slip across the border and execute these bandits, preferably without our neighbour's notice.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.5;We have recently received a letter from a [From.GetTitledFirstName], complaining about banditry in the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. Since the problem spans more than [From.GetHerHis] territory, [From.GetSheHe] claims solving this problem is our responsibility and calls upon us for aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_5;Assure him we will arrange passage for his men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_5;Riders will be sent to hunt down these bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_5;This petty problems are beneath my time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_5_TOOLTIP;[From.GetTitledFirstName] will be allowed to send his men into [From.GetHerHis] neighbour's territory to deal with these bandits, solving this issue.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_5_TOOLTIP;We will spend royal funds to hire lawman, and assure [From.GetTitledFirstName] the issue will be resolved.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_5_TOOLTIP;We will chastise [From.GetTitledFirstName] for wasting [Root.GetHerHis] majesty's time.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.6;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nKnow that I will arrange passage for your men to pursue these bandits into neighbouring territories. I hope without such restrictions, you will be able to put this bandit problem to rest.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.7;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nKnow that I have sent lawmen in the employ of the crown to deal with these troublemakers. I hope they will quickly relieve you of your troubles.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.8;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nKnow that you have wasted not only a good letter, but my precious time. What occurs in your territory is your own problem, and of no concern to the crown.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_EK_6;Now we will eradicate these bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_EK_7;Our faith in [From.GetTitledFirstName] is well placed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_EK_8;The scoundrel!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.10;It appears our waning authority is not enough to keep our inferiors in line. While always fickle and isolationist, the Tribes of the Si Wong Desert have lost all pretences of civility, preying upon our tax collectors instead of paying them. It appears the region has slipped beyond our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_10;A pile of sand is of little loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_10_TOOLTIP;The §YSi Wong Desert Region§! is no longer part of the Earth Kingdom, with territories there no longer paying tribute.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.11;It appears that the various territories in the Si Wong Desert have broken free from the Earth Kingdom, no longer paying royal tax or giving any pretence of loyalty to Ba Sing Se. While in no way a vital region, the change never less gives the notion the once great Earth Kingdom is in decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_11;We never cared for some foreign king.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_11;Perhaps these are changing times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.12;Following the example of previous troublemakers, similar folk who dwell on the fringe of the Earth Kingdom have rebelled against Ba Sing Se rule. Those barbarous mountain people have finally undone the colossal effort our forefathers spent subjugating them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_12;Let those uncivilised brutes slaughter themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_12_TOOLTIP;The §YNorthern Ranges Region§! is no longer part of the Earth Kingdom, with territories there no longer paying tribute.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.13;It appears the transgressions against the Earth King's authority continue, with the mountain folk in the north finally slipping free from Ba Sing Se control. A great deal of fear spreads through neighbouring regions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_13;Finally, we bow to the false King no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_13;Those unruly folk were better subjugated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.14;In this reign, never has the Earth King been more respected or the throne's authority carried so much weight. That authority has limits however, as far as the Dai Li and the royal court are concerned.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_14;For now, I concede to their judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_14_TOOLTIP;As a Puppet King, §YRoyal Authority§! cannot exceed 75%\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.15;In the past few decades, the Earth King has enjoyed great power over all things but it appears that power has grown stretched. The once grand Royal Army is growing complacent, with too much reliance on royal commands, not enough is done by our commander's own initiative. This lack of leadership is becoming clear, and morale is falling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_15; More orders will reverse this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_15_TOOLTIP;§YRoyal Authority§! has risen too high, with subordinates losing the ability to function independently. The leadership of the army is failing.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.16;Over the past few months, taxes from the island provinces off the mainland have dwindled until they ceased entirely. It is clear the governors there no longer respect royal authority and have ceded from the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_16;Those fiendish rebels!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_16_TOOLTIP;The §YEarth Islands Region§! is no longer part of the Earth Kingdom, with territories there no longer paying tribute.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.17;It appears the Earth Kingdom has lost control of all it's provinces beyond the mainland, with the island territories slipping away from Ba Sing Se's control. This only shows that the Earth King's waning authority is continuing the Earth Kingdom's decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_17;The Islands are now free to decide their own fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_17;The Earth Kingdom's power dims.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.18;Despite our best efforts, raiders in service of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have invaded our territory and plundered our lands! For this grave transgression, [From.GetTitledFirstName] goes unpunished. It may humble us, but we need to seek aid from our King if we are to stop this menace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.20;A letter has arrived from a [From.GetTitledFirstName], demanding justice from the capital after [From.GetHerHis] lands were raided by brigands under the banners of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]. It is clear that [From.GetTitledFirstName] seeks either aid from Ba Sing Se or compensation for [From.GetHerHis] losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_20;Very well. We will fine [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] for this misconduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_20;Royal aid will be offered to help [From.GetTitledFirstName] recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_20;Who cares for the wails of the weak?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.21;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nKnow that I have seen fit to extract compensation from [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], which should hopefully sooth your losses. I hope with such justice, you will be able to put this issue to rest.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.22;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nKnow that I have seen fit to extract a fine from you, as punishment for your banditry, which should hopefully sooth the losses of your victims. I hope you accept your punishment as proper justice.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.23;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nKnow that I have seen fit to provide funds to assist your recovery from this terrible crime. I hope with such charity, you and your realm will swiftly recover.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.24;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nKnow that I do not care for those who cannot defend themselves, nor do I care for how many peasants lay slaughtered in your fields. If you truly wish to preserve them, I recommend growing a backbone and defending yourself.\n\n[From.GetHerHisCap] Majesty, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_EK_21;A just King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_EK_22;How dare he!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_EK_23;We are thankful for such benevolence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_20_TOOLTIP;We will extract a fine from [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] to compensate [From.GetTitledFirstName].\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_20_TOOLTIP;We will give relief funds to [From.GetTitledFirstName] from the royal treasury.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_20_TOOLTIP;We will ignore their plight.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.25;Our control over the greater Earth Kingdom continues to wane, against our efforts to keep it in our grasp. More and more of our subjects along the fringes of our Kingdom are claiming one disaster after another for why their taxes never seem to reach the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.26;As the Earth King's authority declines, so do difficulties governing the Kingdom. It appears the Zhaonan region has slipped from Ba Sing Se's control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.27;Difficulties continue, with more and more territories openly breaking away from our Kingdom. This is no longer mere decay, this is treachery and treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.28;The monarchy's power continues to wane, with more provinces breaking free of royal taxes and Ba Sing Se's authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.29;Word has come yet more provinces have chosen to ignore our authority and become traitors. More terrifying though is how close this treachery is spreading to Ba Sing Se, as we lose control of the Huidong Coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.30;The dissent continues to spread through the Earth Kingdom, with provinces not too distant from Ba Sing Se itself, declaring their independence and their refusal to pay the monarch's taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.31;These traitors have struck the Earth Kingdom a most terrible blow. Trouble seems to be stirring not only in the Omashu region, where the Kings have often resisted our power, but in the Hu-Xin Provinces, our most fertile territory. Clearly, unless this decline is reversed, the Earth Kingdom will surely perish!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.32;The Earth Kingdom has now lost it's most fertile and prosperous regions. The loss of these territories signals that perhaps the Earth King's waning authority is not simply another decline in power, but perhaps an invertible plunge into oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.33;More traitors emerge, with more provinces slipping from our grip. We have lost the great and rich cities of Taku and Gaoling, together a terrible loss to the Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.34;More and more of the Earth Kingdom's most vital regions are becoming rebellious, as the wave of dissent continues to spread. Both the great cities of Taku and Gaoling no longer profess loyalty to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.35;Treachery continues to spread, with the many petty kingdoms that make up the central Continent breaking away. One wonders why these traitors didn't run sooner, but it matters not, we will reconquer them in time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.36;The petty kingdoms across the centre of the continent have begun to abandon the greater Earth Kingdom. This leaves Ba Sing Se's territory confined to the north-east corner of the Great Continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.37;The Royal Court has issued the decree that the ongoing crisis shall no longer be spoken of within the city walls. There is no revolt in the Earth Kingdom. The Dongfang Peninsular has not rebelled against the monarch. All is well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.38;The ongoing revolts are no longer anything to be surprised about. The Dongfang Peninsular has slipped from Ba Sing Se's hold. Surely, the end is in sight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.39;Finally, we are alone. All subjects beyond Ba Sing Se's walls laugh at royal proclamations, and ignore their better's authority. Ba Sing Se, the jewel of the Earth Kingdom, is all that remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.40;Ba Sing Se now stands alone, the Earth Kingdom now consisting on a single city. As the monarchy hides behind it's treasured walls, who can say even they will last?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_25_TOOLTIP;The §YZhaonan Region§! is no longer part of the Earth Kingdom, with territories there no longer paying tribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_EK_26;Freedom at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_26;It appears things are changing rapidly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_27;Traitors all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_28;We'll rule ourselves from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_28;These troubles continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_28;We will remain loyal to the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_29;Good riddance to those peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_EK_37;There is no rebellion in Ba Sing Se.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_39;I've lost it all...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.41;After a great effort, it appears that we have resolved the issues with the Royal Army. New officers have been installed who are capable of ensuring that our soldiers are adequately prepared and trained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEK.57;It appears that our most highest liege, Earth [FromFrom.GetKingQueen] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], has chosen to honour us for our service to the Earth Kingdom! From Ba Sing Se's royal court comes praise and appreciation for our deeds as ruler and loyal subject of the Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_57;We are thankful for such praise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.58;The Earth [FromFrom.GetKingQueen]'s power and influence has grown great, and now [FromFrom.GetHerHis] majesty has seen fit to revoke our independence and make us an immediate part of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] realm. It appears there is little we can do to stop this annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_58;It seems we have no choice but to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.59;It seems the all powerful Earth [FromFrom.GetKingQueen] in Ba Sing Se has seen fit to demand we recognise the divine right of the throne above all else, even our own spiritual beliefs. With the vast amount of pressure the throne is levelling against us, we have no choice but to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_59;We will bow for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEEK.60;Dissolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.60;In a shocking turn of events, the ancient Earth Kingdom has been shaken as the Earth [From.GetKingQueen] rewrites the very fundamental laws of the nation. No longer with taxes paid to the royal coffers suffice, nor will [From.GetHerHis] majesty accept honeyed words of loyalty as true fealty. Either subjects will bow at the throne or face conquest by the Royal Army. This marks the start of a new chaotic chapter for the Earth Kingdom, as it's monarch trades the power of influence for the strength of the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_60;This is my new Earth Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EK_60;It seems we must stand alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

earthking_ra_sell_titles_desc;In order to booster the royal coffers, we can sell trivial titles of nobility to many upstart merchants and traders, generating a good amount of income for ourselves, but at the cost of decreasing our standing and authority with the aristocracy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.42;At last, we have restored all that was taken from us. The time has come again to venerate the monarch who sits on the grand throne of Ba Sing Se, the king of all kings. Celebrations shall be held across the entire Kingdom to celebrate this glorious occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_42;Most excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_42_TOOLTIP;§YEarth Monarchism§! has become widespread in Ba Sing Se.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.43;It seems the splendour and power of Ba Sing Se is not what it used to be. No longer is serving the monarch a duty to be proud of. Our armies are not drawing as many volunteers as they used to, in addition to many noble officers choosing to resign. It appears a military disaster is on the horizon. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_43;We must restore the pride of our armies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_43_TOOLTIP;§YRoyal Authority§! has gone too low, with our army's morale failing and our most valuable officers leaving our service.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_EK_44;Good tidings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.45;There appears to be issues emerging in the very foundations of our realm. A combination of lax management and complacency has resulted in a dramatic collapse in efficiency, particularly within the treasury. This may lead to serious financial troubles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCEK.51;With some careful management, it appears our administration problems have been solved. No longer is our Kingdom overtaxed to manage our vast territories and peoples. This will hopefully solve many of our financial problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EK_51;Most excellent news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EK_51_TOOLTIP;Our financial issues have been resolved.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEK.52;There are murmurs of treason everywhere against us. The peasants grumble against our many laws, and the nobles think too much power rests solely upon the throne. There is discontent everywhere, and it seems like it may be bubbling up to something unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_EK_52_TOOLTIP;§YRoyal Authority§! has risen too high, with nobles and peasants alike ungrateful for our benevolent rule.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETLA.4000;The Kyoshi Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4000;It has been a decade since Avatar Kyoshi defeated Chin, and while his empire continues to fragment and crumble across the continent, the Avatar has rarely been seen since. Rumours have spread from Ba Sing Se all the way to the Northern Water Tribe that the Avatar now spends her days training young female peasants in the ways of combat. While this may seem ridiculous to some, more and more of these warrior groups are appearing all over the Earth Islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4000;We're grateful for the Avatar's presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4000;Girl warriors! Hah, what's next?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAC.4000;May tyrants like Chin never return.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAD.4000;This is the legacy I will be proud of.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4001;In a bygone era, the great Sun Warrior civilisation ruled these lands. Now, the Sages say the signs from the Spirits that foretold the fall of their empire, now speak of our rise. With the current extent of our territory and our strong position, the court has advised the time to seize that legacy is now, declaring [Root.GetTitledFirstName] as ruler of all of Agni's people. While some may be convinced to pledge loyalty, others may be displeased by such grandiose titles. Never the less, the choice remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4001;I think… Firelord, will be a fitting title.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4001;No, you will find no such conqueror in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETLA.4002;Birth of Sozin;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4002;A great deal has changed rapidly for the people of the Fire Islands in the recent decades. Relative peace and unity has been introduced by the Firelord's rule, and the nation is quickly changing shape, the old tribal lines disappearing in favour of a new united nation. Now today, word is spreading a new prince has been born to the royal family, by the name of Sozin. The Fire Sages have decided the signs from the heavens above show greatness to come for this child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4002;We are blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4002;May our future Firelord lead this nation wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4003;With the death of Chin the Conqueror, his empire splintered into countless parts. Now, those who still wish to restore Chin's realm are now facing crisis, as their warriors lose heart and their peasants abandon their lands. While this desertion may be fatal to the Chin realms, then the Avatar's renewed efforts to destroy them will be the death blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4003;What fool would destroy such a legacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4003;Good riddance to the last of his empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4004;For the past few decades, the Earth Kingdom has slowly recovered from the great war which saw it conquered by Chin's armies. Yet few lords have returned to Ba Sing Se to pledge their fealty, instead content with the disorder and chaos. This cannot stand. A grand campaign must be organised to reconquer all your rightful territory! We will demand all once again pledge loyalty to the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4004;The wise will bow, the fools will perish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_reunification;We will begin a campaign of reunification to unite the Earth Kingdom once more under a single banner. We will raise two new armies dedicated to this effort, and while the Reunification is ongoing, we will have be able to use the §YReconquest CB§! without cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETLA.4005;Tremors;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4005;Word has come that the Earth King is no longer content to sit idle in Ba Sing Se. The Earth King is preparing a massive military campaign against the rebellious territories, intent once and for all to reconquer all of what Chin usurped. All of the Earth Kingdom must either bow, or face Ba Sing Se's full might.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4005;Of course, the Earth King knows we were always loyal…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAC.4005;Let this Earth King come here and try!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

rw_submit_as_tributary;We will voluntarily submit ourselves to rejoining the Earth Kingdom as a Territory, paying one percent of our income as tax to the Earth King.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4015;A massive wave of dissent is spreading across the Earth Kingdom, as the peasants rise up against the harsh new taxes imposed on them by the Earth King. There are reports that the outer districts of Ba Sing Se have risen up in rebellion and the King has found himself besieged in his own city.\n\nAs riots and chaos grip the capital, the uprising has begun to spread outward into the provinces. The entirety of the Earth Kingdom could soon be torn apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4015;Blasted peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4015;We must crush these upstart rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAC.4015;It seems sparing my realm that taxes has paid for itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAD.4015;This is what happens when one has failed to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETLA.4006;Golden Age of Piracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4006;When an empire collapses, it is a time of chaos for some, profit for others. With the Earth Kingdom still weak from their war with Chin, the seas are left unguarded and vulnerable. The pirates who raid along the southern seas have grown incredibly powerful, plundering freely with little opposition. While some of these bandits are squandering their ill-gotten gains away as usual, other, more ambitious captains are using these funds to build private armies to be reckoned with. It looks like things will become much grimmer for the southern Earth Kingdom and perhaps even beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4006;Raise the sails, boys! There's more loot for the taking!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4006;What can we do against such criminals?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAC.4006;The Earth Kingdom is a terrible place indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4008;Countless seasons have past since the death of Chin the Great, and still, no successor has been able to claim to have united the entirety of his empire. Countless warlords vie for it though, wasting strength against each other as the Earth King gathers his strength! It has recently occurred to you, that if all these followers of Chin could be called together, then maybe, they could come to an agreement on a successor...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLA.4008;I will call this meeting!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4009;Recently, a messenger from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived at our court, claiming that in [From.GetHerHis] capital, [From.GetSheHe] is hosting a meeting of all who claim to succeed Chin himself. [From.GetSheHeCap] begs that we put our differences aside, and all unite to search for the true inheritor of Chin's throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLA.4009;I must go, for that successor is me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLB.4009;I will give no time to such foolish ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4010;Word has come from your spies that your enemies are gathering. Those who seek to follow Chin and tear down your birthright are gathering under the roof of [From.GetTitledFirstName], plotting to crown a new warlord and once again strike against the Earth Kingdom! They must be dealt with, and you have a cadre of assassins standing by to ensure this meeting does not succeed…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLA.4010;Send them immediately. Leave none alive! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4011;After weeks of bickering, no solution has been found. All present believe themselves the rightful inheritor of Chin's empire and none else can persuade them otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLA.4011;This meeting has been a big waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4012;You've arrived at [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s meeting, and for a short time, you entertain pleasantries with other lords from all corners of the old empire. Just as the meeting commences however, there is a sudden rumble. All present draw weapons, calling each other betrayers. There is another rumble, and suddenly the ceiling caves in as Earthbenders collapse the roof on all of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLA.4012;Traitors! I'll have-…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETLA.4013;Fall of the Chin;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4013;There is calamity in the Earth Kingdom, as numerous lords who once strove to succeeded Chin himself are ambushed by assassins as they gathered to decide upon a successor. Rumours abound, but all agree that these lords were buried alive by the Earth King's agents. Countless warlords have fallen in this attack, and now, their realms descend into chaos. Assassins are seen in every corner, accusations of complicity are thrown and brother calls brother traitor. Whatever is left of Chin's Empire has well and truly died.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4013;Such actions from the Earth King, are troubling…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4013;Hahah! See the traitors feast upon themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAC.4013;Traitors! No doubt conspirators aided them…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAD.4013;Perhaps things will be better from now on…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAE.4013;Such troubles for the Earth Kingdom...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CHIN_REALM_SHATTER;In the chaos, accusations fly and pledges of loyalty are revoked. All lords who once pledged their fealty to you have instead chosen to forsake you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETLA.4014;Unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4014;For years now, the Earth King has levied harsh taxes upon the people to fuel the war machine with which the Earth Kingdom will be united. With all able men sent to war, the fields go untended, the people starve and the land becomes desolate. Yet despite this, the Earth King's quest for more power marches ever onward.\n\nThere are whispers now, however, of those within the Earth Kingdom who would dare take action against the throne. While the Earth King has sent agents to silence these troublemakers, the whispers of rebellion grow ever louder.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4014;Foolish peasants should know their place!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ATLAE_END_ERA_UNCERTAINTY;The §YAge of Uncertainty§! is over. The §YAge of Rebellion§! has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLETLA.4020;Fire of Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4020;What begun as resistance to harsh taxes in the Outer Ring of Ba Sing Se has erupted into a riot that is quickly sweeping through the Earth Kingdom capital. Local forces have not been able to respond to such a massive uprising, and battles have begun to rage. The bureaucrats have made the mistake of sending runners throughout the Kingdom to rally against this rebellion, only to inadvertently spread the flames. Everywhere, tales are heard of peasants rising against their lords. No matter if these rebellions are but outbursts of petty resistance, they inspiring a dozen more to follow. Only decades after Chin's fall, the Earth Kingdom is yet again facing crisis, sundering whatever peace was once found. A new era of chaos and revolt is dawning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4020;These peasants will be humbled, I swear it! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4020;Alert the guard for any sign of disobedience!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAC.4020;I wonder if the discontent will spread here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.4021;In following the ideals valued by Chin the Great, we value the ways of strength, something not always appreciated by the weak, like the many peasants that populate our provinces. Stirred on by neighbouring rebellion and meddling sages, the discontent growing amongst the small folk must be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4021;We must abandon the past to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4021;Let the rabble come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unless we confront the problem, an uprising is certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTLA.4023;The Sages have brought to our attention to the heavens, where they claim in ten years, the Great Comet of legend will return to once again blaze across the skies. Its flames will surely set the Fire Isles alight as Firebenders everywhere try to use its power. When it does arrive, there will no doubt be chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTLA.4025;Like the seasons, the day of the Comet has come once again, blazing across the sky and drowning the world in crimson light for hours on end.
