unificationism;Unificationism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unificationism_DESC;Unificationism is a militant philosophy which demands a united continent under the command of a powerful and competent government.

way_of_chin;Way of Chin;;;;;;;;;;;;x
way_of_chin_DESC;Chin the Great was perhaps the world's strongest and charismatic leaders, coming close to seizing the very throne of the Earth Kingdom.

earth_monarchism;Earth Monarchism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
earth_monarchism_DESC;Earth Monarchism is simply a cult of personality surrounding the Earth Monarch. In times of extreme tyranny, those who occupy the throne of Ba Sing Se have often demanded that the common people hold their monarch's authority above anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
children_of_si_wong;Children of Si Wong;;;;;;;;;;;;x

art_of_agni_kai;Art of Agni Kai;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kemurikage;Kemurikage;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kemurikage_DESC;In the time following the Sun Warrior's decline into extinction, chaotic times fell upon the Fire Islands. It was in this era that the legend of the Kemurikage was born: Dark Spirits roaming the nights in search of eternal vengeance. Over time, the truth of their existence has faded, but there are many people who still revere and fear these Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ba_sing_se_cultural_heritage;Ba Sing Se Heritage;;;;;;;;;;;;x

nomadic_nihilism;Nomadic Nihilism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nomadic_nihilism_DESC;Nomadic Nihilism is a rejection of the more mainstream pacifist philosophy held by most Airbenders. This doctrine can be traced back thousands of years to key philosophers who reasoned that in the greater context of the universe, life was meaningless, therefore pointless to bother preserving.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
air_acolytism;Air Acolytism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
air_acolytism_DESC;Air Acolytism is a revival of the lost extinct culture of the Air Nomads. Though non-benders, they aspire to embrace the lifestyle lived by the Air Nomads and aspire for the greater spirituality it granted them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neo-nomadism;Neo-Nomadism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neo-nomadism_DESC;The aftermath of Harmonic Convergence created dozens of new Airbenders in the world, some who have with their new gift joined the Air Nation.

southern_spirituality;Southern Spirituality;;;;;;;;;;;;x
southern_spirituality_DESC;Spirituality is much more lax in the south, different from the strict reverence in the north. There are no named Spirits that inhabit the south, only legends and rumour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_great_swamp;Great Swamp;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_great_swamp_DESC;The Great Swamp is home to the Swamp Tribes, who have lived many eras in the shadow of the Great Banyan Tree.

tui_and_la;Tui and La;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tui_and_la_DESC;Tui and La are the two great Spirits that inhabit the Northern Spirit Oasis. These two Spirits in the form of Koi Fish embody the very Ocean and Moon.

modernism;Modernism;;;;;;;;;;;;x

pirate_faith;Tagaka's Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pirate_faith_DESC;Piracy has long been a plague to maritime trade, especially in times of conflict, where those few equipped to stop it have been too preoccupied. Pirates are simply driven to plunder the trade of the oceans, though these days they prefer the term "high risk traders".;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barbarism;Barbarism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barbarism_DESC;There are the many tribes which hail from the harsh mountains of the Northern Earth Kingdom.

Never the less, a great many tribes settled the lands around it and their descendants retain the knowledge of how one might safely cross the Divide, occasionally guiding travellers for a price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bhanti_spirituality;Bhanti Spirituality;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bhanti_spirituality_DESC;The Bhanti Tribe are an offshoot of the wider Spirituality found in the Fire Islands, following traditions that date long back before the founding of the Fire Nation. As such, they are among the few who remain more dedicated to Spirituality than the more politicised Fire Sages who are closely entwined with the monarchy. They mostly remain on their native island, mostly isolated from others.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_eternal_flame;Eternal Flame;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_eternal_flame_DESC;The Eternal Flame is the last light of the ancient Sun Warrior culture, one of the first civilisations to utilise the power of Firebending.

fortune_telling_reformed;Fortune Telling;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fortune_telling_reformed_reformed_DESC;While often dismissed as a sham or an affront to true Spiritualism, there are many who still believe in the art of Fortune Telling.
