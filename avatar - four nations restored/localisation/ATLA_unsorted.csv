EVTDESCATLA.2;Birth of the new Avatar;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATLA.2;It's me;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.3;News is quickly spreading that Avatar [From.GetFirstName] has perished. Just as the old Avatar has left this world, in sixteen years it is expected a new Avatar will emerge, but such interregnums have often been fraught with trouble, chaos and war.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATLA.3;Such uncertain times...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.4;After 16 years, the elders of my nation has declared me the new Avatar.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATLA.4;I shall do my best.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.5;After sixteen years since the last Avatar perished, a successor has finally been identified as Avatar [From.GetFirstName]. Whether [From.GetSheHe] proves to be worthy of the title, time will tell, but for now what is certain is that the Avatar will set out to master the four elements once more.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEATLA.3;Death of Avatar [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_in.1;[From.GetFirstName] has exposed [From.GetHerselfHimself] on the battlefield and it is as if [From.GetSheHe] is brought to me on a silver platter. The moment is most opportune!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_ent.1;Fire is power! Strength is all I need to persevere!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel_ent.1;The wind is freedom. I shall decide what happens in this battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel_ent.1;The waters are ever-changing under the eternal Moon. ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDduel_ent.1;The very earth under my feet shall obey me. ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFduel_ent.1;I shall draw my weapon and my enemy will know my strength!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEduel_ent.1;A wise fighter knows when it is brave to enter a battle and when it is foolish - today is the latter.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel.1;[From.GetFirstName]'s strong will and determination allows [From.GetHerHim] to quickly overpower me with a flurry of flames. I try my best to think of a way to counter my opponent but I must not ponder, it is now or never!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel.1;After masterfully evading several attacks, [From.GetFirstName] has stopped avoiding and is now facing me! A single soaring wind blast is heading my way. I must now be decisive: what is my next action?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel.1;Spikes of ice and liquid surges home in on me from [From.GetFirstName], whose determination is not easily dissolved. The clear water is elegantly flowing around [From.GetFirstName] and [From.GetSheHe] is preparing for an attack. Now is the chance!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHduel.1;Though not a bender, my opponent [From.GetFirstName] should not be underestimated. After a short but intense dance, [From.GetSheHe] allows me to respond in kind.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel.1;My opponent [From.GetFirstName] makes the ground beneath me roar like a mighty lion elephant and shards of rock rise to do [From.GetHerHis] bidding. [From.GetFirstName] makes a move. This presents an opening to me and I must decide quickly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAduel.1;Hit the most vital organs!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel.1;Strike the torso region!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel.1;Strike the limbs!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDduel.1;Flee!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEduel.1;I must maintain balance and choose which element I shall use.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAduel.2;I look in amazement as the battle has caused more damage to the once-beautiful vista than it has to me. My opponent's relentless use of force has made [From.GetHerHim] forget to maintain [From.GetHerHis] defences. You now have an opening in which to act!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel.2;[From.GetFirstName] is an apt opponent and [From.GetSheHe] uses sudden stealthy strikes and quickly evades any of the attacks I throw at [From.GetHerHim], as befits an airbender. Suddenly however, my opponent makes a poor judgement call and I have an opening to respond!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel.2;The earth has been difficult to stand on, both from [From.GetFirstName]'s attacks and attempts to throw me off balance. As [From.GetFirstName] prepares another attack I see an opening!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel.2;My clothes are soaked and I'm freezing up. The floor is slippery, both from the muddied earth and the random bits of ice lying around. [From.GetFirstName]'s attacks continue. As [From.GetSheHe]  takes a fraction too long drawing water from [From.GetHerHis] waterpack I have a chance!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel.2;[From.GetFirstName] has closed in on me and metal is now clashing a mere arm's length from my face. My opponent is not to be called an unskilled fighter, sustaining my onslaught for so long. It can't last, however, as you manage to sense an opportune moment at which to act!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel.2;Hit the most vital organs!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel.2;Strike the torso region!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel.2;Strike the limbs!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDduel.2;Flee!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel.100;Something;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel.100;Something;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.1;The heat is too strong and [From.GetFirstName]'s formidable attacks have pushed me back. As my defences were down [From.GetSheHe] strikes a last time and the lights fade.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.1;The wind are strong and [From.GetFirstName]'s formidable attacks have thrown me up and down against the ground. As I land a last time I feel a blinding pain at the back of my head.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.1;[From.GetFirstName] has finally got the advantage and my lack of attacks has left me open to attacks. One final attack from [From.GetFirstName] sends a large boulder against me...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.1;My clothes are soaked and a chill has finally reached my bones. [From.GetFirstName] sets [From.GetHerHis] final attack in and body is locked in frozen water. My arms can't move and everything is cold.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.1;[From.GetFirstName] is clearly used to close quarters combat and my attacks find no openings in [From.GetHerHis] defence. After a losing battle, [From.GetFirstName]'s club finally meets my head and I fall into darkness.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.1;This is the end...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.2;A long battle has raged between us. My attack has been blocked by my opponent and I feel completely drained of energy. [From.GetFirstName] sees my wavering concentration and strikes me to the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.2;Every single one of my attacks against [From.GetFirstName] have been avoided and several of [From.GetHerHis] attacks have hit me. Suddenly I feel my feet being swept off the ground. The world spin once or twice and I suddenly hit the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.2;Hindering and launching my own attacks has been exhausting but [From.GetFirstName] is unstoppable. The ground has been shaken under me and suddenly a rock roughly the size of my head is coming towards me. I get thrown back by its impact and land on my back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.2;A fast series of water and ice spears have been thrown at me. I've avoided most, and as I launch my own attack [From.GetFirstName] pushes me down with a large wave from the excess of water the battle has left behind on the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.2;[From.GetFirstName] relentlessly attacks me and I can barely manage a defence. Even though I try my best, I notice a quick punch to my face too late and I fall back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.2;[From.GetFirstName] now has me...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.3;The quick array of small bursts of fire suddenly stops and I see [From.GetFirstName] flee from the fight!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.3;After having avoided and hindered my attacks, I notice [From.GetFirstName] vanish in a cloud of dust!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.3;It seems my attacks has been successful. [From.GetFirstName] has dropped [From.GetHerHis] attacks and is now fleeing the battle!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.3;Even after all the attacks of [From.GetFirstName], suddenly [From.GetFirstName] has turned [From.GetHerHis] back to me and is running away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.3;My superiority has finally resulted in [From.GetFirstName] turning [From.GetHerHis] back to me and running away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.3;Fear me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.4;[From.GetFirstName] has finally put me on my back. The fury is burning in [From.GetHerHis] eyes and I have a choice!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.4;I'm begging you!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.5;[From.GetFirstName] is laying on the floor is begging for [From.GetHerHis] life. What should I do?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.5;I accept and you can go!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel_out.5;I spare you, but you wil be my prisoner.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel_out.5;I decline and this ends here!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.100;[From.GetFirstName] is before me lifeless. A terrible ending to the battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.100;It should never have happened like this...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.101;[From.GetFirstName] has been incapacitated and now I can put [From.GetHerHim] in my custody!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.101;This should end this!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPduel_ent.1;You charge ahead!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPduel_out.4;You beg for mercy and for your opponent to let you go.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATLA.10;The old Avatar is no longer among us and the search has started for the new avatar. The Avatar is the bridge between the two worlds and is the keeper of balance in the world. Maybe I should search for the Avatar?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAATLA.10;I shall make the preparations!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPAATLA.10;You will try your best to start your journey.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBATLA.10;Others will find the Avatar before me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCATLA.11;Able men have agreed to follow you on your quest, no doubt in the hope of the glory of finding the avatar. Food and water has been arranged and now there is only to decide where to begin the search.;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAATLA.16;As you approach a humble hut, you begin to wonder if the mighty Avatar really is this close. The men you hired to come along your journey have suffered much and are hopefull that this is the place where the Avatar will be. You step inside and see a child playing. You give the child some toys, some of which belonged to the previous reincarnations. Without thinking the child plays with the correct toys. You have found the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBATLA.16;Your vigerous search through the countryside has finally ended. Along with your men, you quickly surround the hut. As you circle in, a child comes out along with the elders of the village, preparing to protect the Avatar from harm.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEATLA.16;You found the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAATLA.16;I shall defeat and imprison the Avatar!;;;;;;;;;

TOOLTIPDATLA.16;You will turn back home and not look back.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCATLA.20;Despite your best efforts, no men have joined you yet and several merchants are wary giving you credit for a journey far away.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAATLA.20;The Avatar must be found!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBATLA.20;Then that is how it is...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCATLA.25;The scouts' reports from the land have resulted in nothing but folk tales of children with special powers. It may be time to move on.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAATLA.25;I shall look in another corner of the world!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBATLA.25;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.1;My guardian is a skilled bender to which my own skills can't compare. Even though I train everyday, I make little progress. Maybe I should ask [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.1;I shall ask my guardian for help.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.1;No! I don't need any help!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.2;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is training everyday with me, but I still got some techniques to teach [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.2;I will teach you my techniques.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.2;It should come naturally.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.3;Even though I asked [From.GetFirstName] about [From.GetHerHis] techniques [From.GetSheHe] refused. Apparently I'm supposed to advance on my own...;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.3;That's disappointing...;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.3;Then I will learn it by myself!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.4;Lately [From.GetFirstName] has devoted more and more time to teach me [From.GetHerHis] own techniques and I'm sure I'll improve soon enough!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.4;The hard work begins now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.5;My ward is training hard and is striving to achieve my level of skill. Maybe I should give a helping hand?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.5;Yes, I should help!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.5;Maybe it's better not to...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.6;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has noticed my hard work to reach [From.GetHerHis] level and has now offered a helping hand with achieving that goal.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.6;I will learn from you, Sifu!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.6;I don't need your help.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.7;My technique is near flawless and control over my element is increasing. Even though I've improved, it's clear my guardian is still better.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.7;Maybe I could learn this special technique you have?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.7;It seems like too much work...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.8;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has showed increased interest in my specialised technique and now wants to learn it. It's a difficult technique and maybe too difficult for [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.8;It's too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.8;I will show [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.9;My [GetFromRelation] is a brilliant bender, but unfortunately [From.GetSheHe] deemed it too dangerous for me...;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.9;Perhaps it is for the better...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.10;My [GetFromRelation] is a brilliant bender and [From.GetSheHe] deemed me ready to try one of the most advanced techniques [From.GetSheHe] knows.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.10;Yay!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.11;I'm beyond dispute a skilled bender and my understanding of my element is growing day by day. Today I worked on a new advanced technique I came up with myself and it seems like it is working beyond belief!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.11;This is only the beginning!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.12;A very good friend of mine has developed a very advanced technique and is boasting of the feat.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.12;I should ask for help with achieving the same thing!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.12;It's exaggerated!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.13;After many setbacks and bruises I finally have something to show for it. My bending technique is smoother and control of my element stronger.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.13;I've improved!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.14;I've suffered many bruises and setbacks in pursuit of improving my bending. Despite of all my hard work I've got nothing to show for it. ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.14;All that work... for nothing...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.101;My friend is an excellent bender and is one of the few I know who have specialised and developed a certain kind of bending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.101;I will ask for help with my technique!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.101;I can make it on my own!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.102;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has long admired my bending ability and has finally asked for my help.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.102;I will help for free!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.102;Perhaps a small compensation for the danger?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCtraining.102;It's no concern of mine.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.103;I asked [From.GetFirstName] for help with learning such an advanced move and [From.GetSheHe] agreed to help me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.103;Let the learning begin!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.104;I asked [From.GetFirstName] for help with learning such an advanced move and [From.GetSheHe] agreed to help me for a price.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.104;I will accept.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.104;That is too expensive!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.105;I reached out to [From.GetFirstName] for help with advancing my bending but I was flat out refused. Maybe it is time to rethink our friendship?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.105;Maybe [From.GetSheHe] isn't my friend.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.105;This shouldn't come between us!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.106;Even though I'm no longer young, my knowledge and power have been growing steadily. Maybe I should focus my energy on a special sort of bending?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.106;I will learn a new technique!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.106;I already know enough.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.107;As the seasons go by and my lifetime comes closer to its end, the new generation should take over. My strength has been weakened and now it is time for the children to take over.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.107;I accept my own weaknesses.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCATLA.27;Even though my journey to find the Avatar has been long and tiresome, the Avatar has now been revealed to the world. Now there is nothing else to do than to go home again.;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_RoI_402;You have arrived at the magnificent University of Ba Sing Se. It's a massive complex of gray brick buildings, busy with a bustle of scholars and students. You have been told that people come here from all over the Earth Kingdom and beyond in order to study and exchange ideas. The library has a huge amount of texts in every language known to man.\n\nIt's an impressive place. You don't have much time to spend here, however, so you need to decide what to do...;;;;;;;;;

agni_kai_decision_desc;An Agni Kai is a traditional duel between two firebenders. The two combatants meet at a traditional place the next day, at sunrise, where they will fight until one has been burnt. An Agni Kai may be called when ones honour has been violated or to resolve a dispute. Either way, it is a dangerous challenge that shouldn't be taken lightly.;;;;;;;;;

firelordDESC.15;A Fire Sage has finally replied to your request for aid. Apparently, he believes that your unease may be caused by Spiritual disturbance in the Capital. He requests your permission to accompany you into the Dragonbone Catacombs to find the source of this trouble.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTfirelordB.18;I should leave.;;;;;;;;;x

MARKEToptE.2;I could do with a new spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MARKETdesc.3;In your search, you find a representative from a smith's guild in a neighbouring province. For quite a low price, he'd be willing to make a deal for a significant quantity of weapons and armour to be supplied to your troops, delivered over the coming few years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MARKEToptB.8;I have no need of these Vulture-Snake Oils.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MARKEToptB.9;I have no plans for building anything at this moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MARKETdesc.10;You always fancied yourself quite knowledgeable of money and business, you find the opportunity to purchase a large sum of trade goods from one of the visiting merchants. While a risky investment, it may pay off it's price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MARKEToptB.11;I could do with something more practical.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MARKEToptC.11;This could be of some use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MARKETdesc.12;You seem to be in luck when you come across a merchant selling fabulous jewellery and relics to wealthy nobles. He has a few items that might interest you, magnificent treasures he has found from across the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MARKEToptA.12;This crown is magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MARKEToptB.12;This a crown worthy of my status.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
