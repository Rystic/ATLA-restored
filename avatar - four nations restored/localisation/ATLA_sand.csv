sand_sand_sand_desc;We Sandbenders have always been at home in the Si Wong Desert. We sail where the effeminate rulers of Ba Sing Se fear to tread. Our people are great, our culture strong, our bending the greatest. Now, we have come into such a position where the majority of the Si Wong Desert has come under our command. We stand poised to finally unite the feuding tribes of the desert into an united, formidable front! Let us proclaim a mighty empire, by Sandbenders, of Sandbenders, and for Sandbenders!;;;;;;;;;;x
