EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1100;Before we train to play airplay, we need to learn how to balance on long wooden poles. Over the course of several weeks, we will learn to keep balance and jump on poles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1100;There's no gain without pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1101;After a week of intense training, your legs aches. It is clear that if you want to improve, you need to push on, but it's beginning to take a toll on you. You need to decide whether you're willing keep up with your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1101;I must keep going!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_AIRBALL_1101;I feel I can take it down a notch.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1102;After weeks of intense training, you emerge unquestionably stronger for it. You ache for your efforts, but you've never felt better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1102;I'm definitely a fitter man now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AIRBALL_1102;I feel stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You are one step closer to truly reaching the peak of your power.\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1103;After weeks of intense training, you finally reach the end, legs aching and sore. While you are unsure whether or not you have truly emerged stronger for it, you no doubt have a better appreciation of what a senior player needs endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1103;I most certainly do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1104;After weeks of intense training, you emerge sore and aching. You are unsure whether or not you've truly improved, but never the less, you've come out a fitter player that you were before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1113;Air is the element of freedom. Airbending martial style is known for its constant circular movement, which makes it difficult for opponents to attack directly or land a blow.

EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1140;I am ready for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1141;After a week's progress, you feel completely drained. From sunrise to sunset, you endlessly practise every airbending technique you even could imagine to use in airball.

EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1141;I must perfect every form!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_AIRBALL_1141;I will have to scale back my exercises.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1143;After weeks of practise, you have finally finished every exercise. More senior masters don't find you have sufficiently perfected every form, but you have done well enough to earn their respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1143;For that, I am grateful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AIRBALL_1144;After weeks of exercises, you have finished it all, and yet, the coaches don't feel you have achieved what some one of your ability should be capable of. Never the less, you feel better than ever, both in body and mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_AIRBALL_1144;I will strive to do better!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
