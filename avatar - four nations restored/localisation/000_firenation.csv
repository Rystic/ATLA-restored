sw_2_desc;The ancient Kingdom of the Sun Warriors once spanned the Fire Isles and beyond.

ADUELdesc.901;In a spectacular reversal of fortunes, the Sun Warriors have finally emerged from their decline into extinction, pressing forth to recapture several lost territories. News of these battles is spreading far and wide. This is a shock to many, especially to those beyond the Fire Isles who believed the ancient people a myth. Is is without a doubt now however, that the Eternal Flame shines bright once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ATLABI_EVTDESC_4;After the commotion of the past few, the reality has finally begun to set in. You have a son, [From.GetFirstName]. You wonder, and secretly hope, if [From.GetFirstName] will be one of the first Airbender's born in over a century, but only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLABI_4;You are special to us no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.4;Joyous news has reached you today. While the Sages may have assured you that the royal bloodline was well assured, the news that Prince Iroh, has finally created fire has put all unsaid anxieties as ease. As long as those within the line of succession continue to bend fire, Agni continues to shine his blessings upon our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.4;Fantastic news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.5;As you are well aware, being born to one day ascend to the position of Firelord is a far more challenging destiny than it seems. Your son and heir, Iroh, has however continued to succeed beyond such lofty expectations. Numerous tutors and instructors report that the prince shows great promise, a diligent student as well as a natural Firebender. It is clear he is meant for greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.5;We are blessed to have such a son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_B.5;There are a great many more things a future Firelord requires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.6;Today, the young Prince Iroh gave a demonstration of his Firebending abilities. While the young Prince is no master just yet, he shows clear promise to further develop his abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.6;I am pleased with the Prince's progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.7;Prince Iroh has once again demonstrated his Firebending abilities before the royal court, impressing many with his skill and strength. Before, the young Prince showed promised, but it is now clear that if he continues to hone his skills, he may become one of the greatest Firebenders seen in the royal family since Firelord Sozin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.7;Most excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.8;While conflict rages elsewhere around the world, the young Prince Iroh has dutifully continued his studies. As the Fire Nation continues to battle it's enemies abroad, it was always certain that one day Prince Iroh would need lead an army into battle. So far, it seems he has learned well from the many tacticians and strategists in the royal court, as well as showing a keen interest in the tactics of our enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.8;To destroy the Earthbenders, one must destroy their walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_B.8;To destroy the Earthbenders, one must attack relentlessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.9;A celebration was held today in the royal palace to commemorate Prince Iroh, who has finally completed his studies. He has learned well, emerging as a promising strategist who well no doubt serve you well. Before he joins the army abroad however, Prince Iroh asks you one favour, and that is to journey to Aztlan, ancient home of the Sun Warriors, so that he may prove his mettle as a Firebender by slaying the Dragons that are rumoured to still inhabit the ruins there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.9;Go my Prince, if there are still Dragons there, you will surely slay them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.10;After a lengthy journey to Aztlan, Prince Iroh has made a late return without his escort, but never the less victorious. He reports a successful hunt, slaying the last Dragons of Aztlan, dearly guarded by the Sun Warriors there. None dare question the feat, especially after Prince Iroh demonstrates even more magnificent Firebending than when he first left. It is a great day of pride the Prince proves himself worthy of the title of Dragon, perhaps the last Firebender to ever do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.10;To Prince Iroh, Dragon of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.11;You have been told today that it has indeed been proved that Ozai is indeed a Firebender, as is expected of a Prince of the Fire Nation. It is trivial news, but news none the less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.11;All is as should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescD.17;You strike your opponent with a watery limb before freezing it, trapping them in place. You follow up the attack, sending water barrelling towards them before freezing it mid-flight. Frozen to the spot, [hostile.GetFullName] is forced to face the attack head on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.17;You strafe your opponent, carrying the wind with you. With a pulling motion, you pull them off their feet with a gust of air, before striking again with an even more powerful attack. Stunned, [hostile.GetFullName] is hit directly by the blast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescE.20;You continue to use your Airbending to weave and evade attacks, but you fail to find any openings to counter yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.21;A momentary lapse has [From.GetFullName] close in on you, striking several blows you barely manage to survive. You stagger back, barely managing to evade further attacks and recover. The damage is done though, as you feel blood roll across your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.21;A misplaced step causes you to falter, and [From.GetFullName] takes full advantage, using Earthbending to kick a pillar of rock towards you. It hits you head on, and your sent flying onto your back. As you stagger back up, barely evading the follow up attack, you taste blood in your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescD.22;One of your enemy's watery limbs catches you, freezing your feet to the ground. Before you can free yourself, [From.GetFullName] sends a high pressured blast of water barrelling towards you. Trapped, you are struck with the full force of the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.22;Your opponent continues to strafe you, before striking out. A gust of air sweeps you off your feet, before [From.GetFullName] attacks you again with another blast of air. Stunned, you are hit by the full force of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.23;Your opponent charges towards you, swinging repeatedly with their weapon. You find yourself hard-pressed to endure the attack, and [From.GetFullName] manages to land several glancing strikes against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.23;Your opponent raises a pillar out of the ground, before shattering it with a kick and sending the remains flying at you. Rocks fly everywhere, and several of various sizes manage to hit you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescC.23;Your opponent closes in, sending flames flying out of [From.GetHerHis] hands towards you. You manage to evade several of these blasts, but you are caught a few times by the scorching fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescD.23;Your opponent sprouts watery tendrils from [From.GetHerHis] arms, before sending them flying towards you.

ADUELdescE.24;Your opponent throws both hands together, creating a blast of air that causes you to stagger backwards. Recovering from only being momentarily stunned, you fight on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.25;Your opponent takes several misjudged swings with their weapon, all of them you easily evade or block.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.25;Your opponent sweeps an arm upward, sending several stones from the floor flying towards you. All of them either miss or impact harmlessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescC.25;Your opponent closes in, attempting to strike you physically with blows empowered with burning fire, but you manage to evade them, backing out of range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescD.25;You take cover as your opponent bends a puddle of water into the air, before freezing and sending the icicles raining down upon you. They shatter harmlessly against your shelter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.25;You continue to press forward, refusing to give your opponent the advantage. Your enemy continues to use Airbending to move around you, weaving past your attacks but unable to find the time to strike back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.26;You choose not to attack, instead keeping your distance. You watch and wait for your enemy to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.27;Your opponent chooses not to attack, instead keeping distance and adopting a defensive stance. It is clear your enemy is waiting for you to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.16;A fatal mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.17;This battle shouldn't last longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.18;An adequate strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.19;I need to strike truer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.19;Damn them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.20;Dammit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.21;I must fight on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.22;This I'll survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.22;I'm barely scratched!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.23;That was painful…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.23;I've survived worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.24;A mere wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.24;I'm unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.25;I must press this advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.26;The best offence is defence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.27;It makes this all the easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_ATK_EARTHBENDER_TOOLTIP;The trait §YEarthbender§!, enables you to use the §YEarthquake§! ability a single time per battle for the cost of stamina, adopting a style of attack that denies your enemy any cover or retreat. This ability will permanently reduce their §BDefence§! by §R-1§! for the remainder of this battle, in addition to decreasing the chance of them evading your attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_ATK_LIGHTNING_TOOLTIP;The trait §YLightningbender§!, enables you to use the §YLightning Strike§! ability for the cost of stamina, allowing you a chance to deliver fatal damage to an enemy. Beware however, your enemy may redirect your attack if they too are capable of this ability. If successful, this ability will strike your opponent for §R100§! critical damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.29;You adopt a much more aggressive style, pressing forward and slamming a foot to shake the ground itself. You bend the rock beneath you, not pulling up walls between you and your opponent, but causing them to rise up around them, trapping them in your sights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.29;They'll be an easier target, now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.30;Your opponent takes a much more aggressive approach with [From.GetHerHis] earthbending, beginning to abandon defending [From.GetHerselfHimself] and instead focusing on bending earthen walls out of the ground to surround you. Overcome by this, you become more exposed to your opponent's attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.30;I can withstand this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_EARTHQUAKE_HIT_TOOLTIP;Your opponent uses their §YEarthbending§! abilities, permanently lowering your §BDefence§! by §R-1§! for the remainder of the battle, in addition to decreasing your chance of evading enemy attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.28;Beaten, [From.GetFullName] collapses to the ground before you. All can see that this battle has come to a close, with you as the rightful victor! [From.GetFullName] looks up at you, awaiting [From.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.28;This was an honourable battle. You may go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.28;I will show you no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptC.28;Now, you are my prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptD.28;Suffering will teach you your place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptE.28;A good duel, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.31;[From.GetFullName] strikes you again, and this time you cannot endure anything more. You collapse to the ground, and find yourself unable to rise again, only succeeding at staggering onto your knees. You look up to see [From.GetFullName] standing over you and yourself at their mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.31;I do not fear….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_EXECUTE_ENEMY;You will kill [hostile.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_CAPTURE_ENEMY;You will take [hostile.GetFullName] prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_BURN_ENEMY;You will teach [hostile.GetFullName] the meaning of suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_SPARE_ENEMY;You will let [hostile.GetFullName] walk away, beaten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_SPAR_ENEMY;You have concluded your spar with [hostile.GetFullName], emerging victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.32;It seems [From.GetFullName] is not a merciful opponent. You fall to the ground, tired, beaten and unable to muster any strength as [From.GetFullName] stands over you, preparing to deal the final blow…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.32;I accept my defeat. I am at peace with that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.32;You are nothing but dishonourable scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptC.32;I swear, my kin will make you pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.33;After you fall to your knees, defeated, [From.GetFullName] declares you a prisoner. Dishonourably captured by your opponent, time will only tell what fate has waiting for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.33;One day I'll get you back for this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.34;Crumbling to your knees, beaten, you look up to see [From.GetFullName] standing over you. There is no hint of mercy in [From.GetHerHis] cruel gaze. [From.GetSheHeCap] reaches out to your face with a hand still burning...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.34;ARRRGGGHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.35;Defeated, all that is left for you to crumble to your knees and await your fate. [From.GetFullName] stands over you, but [From.GetSheHe] does not raise a hand against you. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] offers it, choosing to leave you be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.35;I thank you for your mercy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.35;How dare you humiliate me! Pretend I'm not a threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.36;[From.GetFullName] remains standing, emerging victorious from this duel. You rise to your feet, and as custom, bow to your opponent, [From.GetFullName] returning the gesture. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.36;This was an honourable exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.37;In the face of death, [From.GetFullName] shows no dishonour, remaining still as you strike the final blow. With [From.GetFullName] dead, you walk forth from the duelling ground the undisputed victor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.37;[From.GetFullName] has been dealt with, that's all that matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.37;I emerge stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.38;In the face of death, [From.GetFullName] does not go quietly, cursing your name and promising retribution. With the final blow, the insults and threats are silenced and the duel ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.38;I'll take my chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.39;Your men quickly move forward, securing [From.GetFullName] are dragging them from the field. The battle is done, and you return homeward with [From.GetFullName] as your prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.39;This will be the end of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.40;You strike, fire flowing forth and over [From.GetFullName]. Screaming, [From.GetFullName] falls to the ground, burnt by the flames vicious heat. [From.GetFullName] is dragged away alive, but never the less scarred forever by your hand, a permanent mark of dishonour. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.40;I've taught you your place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.41;[From.GetFullName] seems surprised at your mercy, but accepts it, rising to [From.GetHerHis] feet and bowing. Whatever ill will between you seems forgotten in this act of mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.41;There is nothing more between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.42;Despite your show of mercy, [From.GetFullName] remains knelling on the ground, clear disgust on [From.GetHerHis] face. You walk away, leaving them disgraced, unworthy of even killing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.42;Consider this a final insult to you, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.43;You offer [From.GetFullName] your hand, and [From.GetSheHe] takes it, and you pull [From.GetHerHim] back to [From.GetHerHis] feet. You and your opponent bow, ending this exercise. When you rise, [From.GetFullName] nods, respectful of your victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.43;We both grow stronger for our trials.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.44;You ground yourself, adapting the stance that will allow you to channel electricity through your body as you clench a hand into a fist. Feeling the power surging, allow your fingers to curl outward, crackling with energy, before releasing it completely in the direction of your enemy. A lightening bolt erupts from the tip of your finger, rocketing towards your opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdesc.45;[From.GetFullName] ceases attack for a second, before you notice a crackling in the air. It is too late, as [From.GetFullName] unleashes this power towards you, bending lightning itself. The strike hits you, electricity surging through your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.45;Argghhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.45;Arrrgghhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_LIGHTENING_HIT_TOOLTIP;Your opponent uses their §YLightningbender§! ability, striking you for massive damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_LIGHTENING_REVERSE_TOOLTIP;You redirect your opponent's lightning attack against them…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.46;[From.GetFullName] ceases attack for a second, before you notice a crackling in the air. You have a mere moment to dodge before [From.GetFullName] unleashes lightning itself towards you. The attack misses, exploding against the ground behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.46;A lucky escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.47;[From.GetFullName] doesn’t attempt to evade as you direct the attack, instead catching it with one hand before channelling it through the body, then unleashing it back at you. You have no time to react as your own lightning hits you dead on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.47;Oh…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.48;[From.GetFullName] is struck by the redirected lightning, the energy hitting dead on. For a slight second, [From.GetFullName] sways, before collapsing to the ground, dead. Silence washes over everyone around. The duel is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.48;This battle is finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdesc.49;You gather your inner Chi energy, focusing it through your body before channelling it into the tattoo on your forehead. Feeling the energy building like a flood against a dam, you release it, causing it to shoot out and towards your opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUEL_COMBUSTION_GOT_HIT_TOOLTIP;Your opponent uses their §YCombustionbender§! ability, catching you in the explosion and causing some damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.52;You turn to see [From.GetFullName] standing still, channelling energy into [From.GetHerHis] forehead tattoo. You move as [From.GetSheHe] unleashes a devastating Combustion blast, narrowly avoiding the blast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.52;That bending is very dangerous…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_COMBUSTION_GOT_MISS_TOOLTIP;Your opponent uses their §YCombustionbender§! ability, which you manage to evade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELoptA.81;How!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.82;You decide to deliver a quick end to this battle, controlling the air around your opponent and beginning to bend it, funnelling all the air out of the area around them. Trapped within this vacuum, [From.GetFullName] begins to struggle…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.82;A little longer…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.83;You are taken by surprise when [From.GetFullName] sweeps you off your feet with a blast of Airbending, before suddenly creating a twister around you. Trapped within, you slowly begin to choke in this vacuum, barely able to break free in time before you suffocate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.83;….;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.84;[From.GetFullName] finally goes limp, and you release your hold of the air. [From.GetFullName] hits the ground and stays there, before suddenly coughing and once again breathing in. Alive, but barely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdesc.85;You are taken by surprise when [From.GetFullName] sweeps you off your feet with a blast of Airbending, before suddenly creating a twister around you. You manage to break free, striking back at [From.GetFullName] and ending this gruesome attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELoptA.86;You shall not be so lucky next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELoptA.87;This should slow you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.88;[From.GetFullName] suddenly strikes out, with a flurry of punches and kicks. You stagger backwards, stunned by the attack. Your limbs feel numb, and your bending seems… weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.88;I'll fight on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.89;[From.GetFullName] suddenly strikes out, with a flurry of punches and kicks. You manage to evade the brunt of the attack, with only minor wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.89;You'll need to try harder than that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.90;Drawing your weapon, you charge towards [From.GetFullName]. You swing several heavy blows, intending to cripple your opponent and turn the odds of this battle even further in your favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.90;You won't be a threat much longer…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.91;[From.GetFullName] draws a weapon, and before you know it, begins raining down heavy blows upon you. You barely evade some swings, others landing with crippling effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.91;I must fight through the pain!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.92;[From.GetFullName] draws a weapon, and before you know it, begins raining down heavy blows upon you. You duck and dodge every swing, managing to avoid the crippling blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.92;Speed wins out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.93;The time has come to swiftly defeat your opponent. You pull the toxic dart you prepared earlier, careful not to touch the crippling poison on its tip, and throw it, sending it flying towards [From.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.93;You won't endure this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.94;You're caught by surprise when [From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a dart, flinging it towards you. It impacts on your arm, and you quickly pull it out. It is too late however, for you already feel the poison flowing through your body…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.94;Curse you, you venomous snake! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.95;You're caught by surprise when [From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a dart, flinging it towards you. You barely manage to sidestep it in time, as the poisonous dart flies past you. A close call.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.95;No more tricks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.96;The time has come to use your very special skills. Pulling out one of the explosive charges you prepared earlier, you light the fuse and pitch it towards [From.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.96;Dodge this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.97;[From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a metal cannister, lighting a fuse and pitching it towards you. You leap, but the explosive ignites and catches you in its blast. You feel the heat and fury of its detonation as you are flung backwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.97;I'll live!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.98;[From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a metal cannister, lighting a fuse and pitching it towards you. You leap just in time as the explosive device detonates, and you roll away, feeling the heat of the blast, but escaping unharmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.98;Your bombs won't stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.99;Its time to end this battle! Clasping your hands together, you block out your worldly surroundings and focus. Channelling the energies within you, you enter the Avatar State, your eyes shining white. [From.GetFullName] steps back, stunned by your power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.99;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.100;You turn and see [From.GetFullName]'s eyes suddenly begin to shine white. Streams of rock, water and fire forming around them, they levitate up into the air. Awestruck by the Avatar's sheer power, you cannot escape its wrath as the Avatar strikes the ground, sending you flying back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.100;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.101;You slam down into the earth, sending [From.GetFullName] flying back. You fly through the air, landing not far away. FROM is struck by your power, and cannot stand against it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After a moment, [From.GetTitledFirstName] replies positively, saying it would be right in certain situations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4517_B;You decide to press further with your questions to [From.GetTitledFirstName], asking if she would be truly prepared to take a life in the course of justice. After a moment, [From.GetTitledFirstName] replies negatively, saying that isn't a decision she can make.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4517;I think the time has come to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4517_TOOLTIP;Invite §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to join the Kemurikage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4517;I don't feel [From.GetTitledFirstName] has enough conviction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_4517;If you cannot do so, then we are done talking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4518;[kemurikage_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] turns to you now and asks if you really could put words into action. She asks if you have ever heard of the Kemurikage Sisterhood, an order dedicated to preserving justice and order in the Fire Isles, and if you're willing to learn more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4518;I'll accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4518_TOOLTIP;Agree to the offer and begin the process of joining the §YKemurikage Sisterhood§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4518;No, I cannot do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4518_TOOLTIP;Decline the offer and pretend this never happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4519;[From.GetTitledFirstName] stammers and then rapidly excuses herself. It seems she does not have what it takes to join the Sisterhood, though your sisters will keep a close eye on her to ensure she doesn’t divulge any of this at a later date. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4519;A true pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4519_TOOLTIP;Your attempt to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to the Kemurikage has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4520;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to your offer, eager to learn more. You are satisfied with the outcome, and promise to explain more to her over the coming days.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4520;An excellent choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4520_TOOLTIP;Your attempt to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to the Kemurikage has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4521;[kemurikage_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] takes you to a hidden shrine, home to many murals of Kemurikage, telling you the history of the Sisterhood. The original Kemurikage were Spirits of Vengeance who extracted a heavy price from the cruel warlords of the Fire Isles. Now, the Sisterhood does the same, punishing the wicked and preserving the stability of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4521;Most intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4521_TOOLTIP;You continue your efforts to join the §YKemurikage Sisterhood§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4522;Finally, [kemurikage_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] introduces you to [grand_master.GetTitledFirstName], Grandmaster of the Sisterhood. She asks you whether or not you are finally ready to pledge your loyalty to the Sisterhood and the protection of the Fire Isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4522;I will join.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4522_TOOLTIP;You agree to join the §YKemurikage Sisterhood§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_MNSAK_4522_TOOLTIP;You will end your attempt to the join the §YKemurikage Sisterhood§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4523;After agreeing to join, the joining ceremony begins shortly after. In front of the Grandmaster, you are asked to take a vow of allegiance to the Sisterhood, to never divulge it's secrets, and to follow the commands of the Grandmaster, to better protect and preserve the people the Sisterhood serves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4523;I pledge you my undying loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4523_TOOLTIP;You pledge your loyalty to the §YKemurikage Sisterhood§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4524;Thank you, Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4525;You leave, hurrying from the Shrine and leaving the Sisterhood behind. They silently watching you go from behind their masks, and you cannot help but think you will indeed suffer if you ever divulge what happened here today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5048;Recently, a letter from your fellow Agni Kai member, [FromFrom.GetFullName], arrived, inviting you to participate in a friendly sparring match on duelling grounds. Defeating [FromFrom.GetFullName] in the arena would be a step forwards advancing in the Society.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5048;Tell [FromFrom.GetHerHim] I'm unfortunately too busy at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5049;Word has returned from [From.GetFullName] that [From.GetSheHe] is more than happy to accept your invitation for a sparring match.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5048;I'll prove myself a worthy opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5050;Word has returned from [From.GetFullName] that [From.GetSheHe] is unfortunately unable to meet you on the duelling ground for a sparring match, instead [From.GetSheHe] is currently preoccupied by other matters. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5050;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4528;As part of your interest into this rumour of this 'Enlightened' Society, you have spent many days in local shrines, studying old scrolls and books to better your knowledge of any and all things Spiritual. One day, a fellow visitor, [enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] approaches you, chuckling when [enlightened_recruiter.GetSheHe] sees what you are reading. [enlightened_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] suggests you look elsewhere for true knowledge of the Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4528;And where do you suggest I look?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4528;Go away, I'm busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4529_A;As part of your duties, you approach [From.GetFullName], a prospective recruit of the Enlightened, at a local shrine where [From.GetSheHe] is busy studying the Spiritual world.

EVTOPTC_MNSAK_4529;I bid you good day then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4530;[enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] tells you that there is greater wisdom than any scribe would be willing to share with you. In pursuit of true knowledge of the Spirits and their domain, one must seek a proper and wise master, not books, for the answers. [enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] asks you if you are truly invested enough in this to really discover such secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4530;I'd do anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4530;I have better things to do, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4531_A;You further tell [From.GetFullName] that one must seek a true master of the spiritual arts to really understand the secrets of the world. [From.GetTitledFirstName] reacts positively to your words, and asks you if you truly know such a master that could enlighten [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4531_B;You further tell [From.GetFullName] that one must seek a true master of the spiritual arts to really understand the secrets of the world.

EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4531;I do not sense true commitment from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_4531;Then you will never find the wisdom you seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4532;[enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] tells you indeed there is a master who could teach you, and [enlightened_recruiter.GetSheHe] would be more than willing you to show you the way. To reach this master though, one must travel to a spiritual nexus of this world, the northern pole itself, to find this master. [enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] warns you once you set off, there will be no turning back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4532;I will do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4532_TOOLTIP;Agree to the offer and begin the process of joining the §YEnlightened§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4532;Hah hah, no, you must be kidding?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4532_TOOLTIP;Decline the offer and pretend this never happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4533;When you offer to take [From.GetFullName] to the gathering place of the Enlightened, [From.GetTitledFirstName] only stutters and awkwardly brushes off the conversation, claiming they could never do such a thing. It is clear [From.GetSheHe] lacks any conviction to do such a thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4533;A shame then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4533_TOOLTIP;Your attempt to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to the Enlightened has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4534;[From.GetTitledFirstName] fully agrees to your offer, and together, you begin plans to journey to the Enlightened's gathering place at the northern Spirit Portal. You send the appropriate messages ahead so that the Grandmaster will be waiting for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s arrival when the time comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4534;Shall we then?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4534_TOOLTIP;Your attempt to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to the Enlightened has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4535;You set off for the long journey north, crossing endless tundras that stretch on forever. As you travel the harsh northern lands, [enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] tells you many legends you've never heard, of how Spirits used to roam the physical world freely in a golden era and wise shamans led the tribes to live truly piously in balance with the Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4535;All of this is intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4535_TOOLTIP;You continue your efforts to join the §YEnlightened§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4536;Finally, you reach an impossible grove amidst the lifeless tundra. Here, [enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] leads you before a shimmering light. It is here another visitor emerges from the forest, [grand_master.GetTitledFirstName] introducing [grand_master.GetHerselfHimself]. [grand_master.GetSheHeCap] tells you this light used to be a portal between worlds, until the ignorance of the Avatar destroyed it. [grand_master.GetSheHeCap] asks you if you are willing to do whatever it takes to break the seal and usher in a new era of wisdom and balance once again, and if you are willing to join them in doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4536;I will help you in this endeavour. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4536_TOOLTIP;You agree to join the §YEnlightened§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNSAK_4536;No, this is foolish! Insane!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4537;[grand_master.GetTitledFirstName] nods in acknowledgement of your pledge and asks you swear loyalty to [grand_master.GetHerHim], grandmaster of the Enlightened, so that you may join their society and their work to build a better world in service of both Humanity and the Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4537;I so pledge my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4538;Thank you, Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4539;You run back into the tundra as dark shadows emerge from the forest around you. [grand_master.GetTitledFirstName] and [enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] only seem to lower their heads in disappointment as monstrous beings of light appear from the trees.

[white_lotus_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] speaks of the necessity of well thought out strategy, not simply taking the most apparent move. [white_lotus_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] likens it to leadership, something you would be familiar with. [white_lotus_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] asks if you feel applying a similar philosophy to such matters is just as wise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4544;A ruler must always do what is wise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5094;You have spent more time researching the ancient world your brethren told you of, a time before the Avatar, nations or even the bending arts. It is clear that Humanity has wounded the balance of the world, carving civilisation out of the bones of the very beings that once sheltered them. Perhaps one day these wrongs might be made right…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5094;Through the past, we see a better future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5095;You have spent weeks delving into the most dark and forbidden texts, learning more and more of ancient Spirits long ago banished to the depths of the Spirit World. This Spirit embodies disease and plague itself, and you may learned a way to bring this Spirit's deathly gaze back upon the physical world, if only for a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5095;This may come in handy…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5096;As you gain trust among your fellow Enlightened, you become partial to more secrets the society holds. As you are a Novice no longer, your senior brethren are now willing to instruct you further in using the Spiritual energy in the world to your own ends. Spirits may embody many things, even darkness, but even they can be made into tools…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5096;I have learned so much… ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5097;As you become a Guide, tasked with shepherding less experienced members of the society, so do the final secrets of the Enlightened become known to you. At the shining light where you first joined the society, so does the Herald inform you of it's true purpose: a gateway to the Spirit World and the resting of the great Spirit Vautu, who will one day return with the Enlightened's aid at the time of Harmonic Convergence, cleansing the world of stagnation and restoring true balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5097;Restoring balance is our great purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tes_inflict_terror;Inflict Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tes_inflict_terror_desc;As a knowledgeable member of the Enlightened, we can control minor Dark Spirits for our own purposes, such as unleashing one upon an unsuspecting foe, leaving them none the wiser who is responsible for their terror. We may step in to their rescue, gaining their favour, or we might simply let things get out of hand…;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5099;After some preparation, you are ready to teach [From.GetTitledFirstName] a lesson [From.GetSheHe] will never forget. All that remains now is to select carefully which Spirit you will coax into the physical realm to attack [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5099;I can handle a simple Spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5099;Something large and dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5099;I will summon the most vile Spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNSAK_5099;A Spirit of plague to blight [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tes_it_summon_minor_spirit;We will summon a relatively small Dark Spirit, likely to inflict a good fright, but not dangerous enough to risk growing out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tes_it_summon_plague_spirit;We will use our study of the Plague Spirits to summon one, in hopes that the sheer pestilence emanating from it inflicts sickness and death upon our victim. Because of the risks, we cannot step in after the summoning is complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5100_A;Asleep one night alongside your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], you bolt awake, a chill running through your body, frozen as you find a dark shadow at the end of your bed. A menacing wolf-like form, it begins to prowl towards you and your spouse. It opens it's eyes and they shine bright red. A moment later, the beast pounces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5100_B;You wake from your sleep one night, frozen as you find a dark shadow at the end of your bed. A menacing wolf-like form, it begins to prowl towards you. It opens it's eyes and they shine bright red. A moment later, the beast pounces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5100;Out of here, foul beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5099;Someone! HELP!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5100;Stay away from [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5101_A;You struggle in the dark with the beast as it snaps its jaws at you. You are unable to even get a hold of it, as it feels like the creature's skin is nothing but slick oil. As you try to fend it off, it snaps at you again, biting into your hand and crushing several fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5101_B;The beast attacks, and as you leap to your feet, it instead goes for the waking [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]. [Root.Spouse.GetSheHeCap] screams as it attacks [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim], and you strike at it, battering it off. [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] falls to the floor, bloodied, but alive. You look for the beast, but is has disappeared as quickly as it arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5101_C;You manage to slip away from the beast's attack, rolling out of bed and onto the floor. It turns to face you, growling as you roll to your feet with hands raised, standing off with the creature. It growls, before bounding off the bed and out of the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5101;Arggh!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5101;Guards! Hunt that thing at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5101;Guards! After it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5102;You are asleep one night, only to awaken to find your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] fighting some invading beast right beside you! Before you can react, the beast lashes out at you, biting into your arm before [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] drives it off. What a terrifying night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5102;Argh! This your fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5103_A;From your position nearby, you hear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s screams as well as that of [From.GetHerHis] [From.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] [From.Spouse.GetFirstName] as the small, vicious Dark Spirit attacks [From.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5103;[From.GetSheHeCap] is my liege after all…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5103;[From.GetSheHeCap] is family after all…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNSAK_5103;Guess I better end this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5103;No, I think I'm enjoying this too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5104;The Beast is driven off, disappearing into the night. The guards search everywhere, and eventually blame a door being left open by a careless cook who is promptly fired. While in retrospect, you know it was a simple creature, it never the less haunts you like a monster…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5104;I don't I'll sleep well for a long time…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5105;[From.GetTitledFirstName] escapes the Dark Spirit's attack alive, and guards sweep the building for a wild animal, searching everywhere for where it could have escaped, and eventually end up framing a staff member to take the fall. [From.GetTitledFirstName] is left haunted by the event regardless, and will not sleep well for quite a while…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5105;Me myself, I'll be sleeping well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5106;The Beast disappears around a corner, when you hear a heavy thud. Outside, you find [From.GetTitledFirstName], standing over the beast's corpse. [From.GetSheHeCap] offers apologies for not being quicker, as [From.GetSheHe] was nearby and heard the commotion, rushing as quickly as possible to deal with the creature. Now, this nightmare is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5106;You have my gratitude!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5107;You call the Dark Spirit before you, lulling it back to the Spirit World once it disappears out of sight, before replacing it with the dead critter you smuggled in. [From.GetTitledFirstName] rushes in, finding the beast dead before you. Not before long, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is graciously thanking you for your intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5107;I'm sure you'll repay me well…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5108;One night, you awaken. A chill rushes through you as your body refuses to move. Your eyes dart to a dark shape at the end of your bed, a monstrous, snail like creature, gazing down at you. For several seconds, you struggle against your paralysis, but the snail like creature moves away and you fall back into sleep…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5108;Wha...What?…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5109;You awaken the next morning, feeling absolutely dreadful. More than just being haunted by your nightmare, your body aches and you start to develop a cough out of nowhere. Soon, you are forced to retire early as sickness suddenly overcomes you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5109;This dream was surely an omen…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5110;The next morning after your dark work, [From.GetTitledFirstName] stumbles in looking half-dead already. Stuck in a stupor, [From.GetTitledFirstName] hastily retires from court after beginning to being overcome by a terrible fit of coughing. It is clear you have achieved what you set out to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5110;I'll stay clear, just in case.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5112;With help of your fellow Enlightened, you have gathered many tomes of knowledge, and now, you just wonder where you shall focus your studies, whether to grow more shrewd or to research further into the bending arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5112;I will better my bending.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5112;Knowledge is power, and I shall further mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MNSAK_TES_5112_B;You will have the chance to attain a powerful trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNSAK_TES_5112_C;You will uncover a rare type of bending, perhaps one long forbidden…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5113;For the past few weeks, you have studied ancient bending scrolls and documents. With constant practice, you have made advances you yourself never thought possible. You have made amazing strides.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5113;This will benefit me greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5114;For weeks, you have poured over ancient knowledge, philosophy and the most forgotten lore. You have learned so much, and have developed new insights into how you might use this information to shape the future. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5114;Many insights indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5115;Stumbling upon ancient bending scrolls, you spend weeks practising, and finally today, bring the long forgotten bending art you discovered back to life. Your new skill is devastating and very quickly lethal. People would fear you for this kind of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5117;The time has come to eliminate the annoyance that is [From.GetTitledFirstName]. You have prepared a solution, and best of all, one that is impossible to trace back to you. Rather than a dagger, you will summon a furious Spirit to deal with your enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5117;The perfect crime, I'd say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5118;You awaken one night to find large, spider like eyes looming over you. You have no idea what you have done to deserve this fate before the monster descends upon you. By time others arrive to the commotion, you are already dead and you're killer long gone…;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5119;The next morning, the news reaches you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] died a messy death in [From.GetHerHis] sleep.

EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5144;I will undertake Firebending training.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5144;I will learn Smokebending.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5145;You have spent a week focusing on your physical training, focusing on both your strength as well as your agility as you train alongside your fellow sisters. It is taking it's toll however, and you're not sure whether you can keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5148;I'm healthier, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5149;You have journeyed to practice your Firebending under the watchful eyes of senior members of the Sisterhood, who instruct you in more nuances of the art than you ever thought there were. Practising daily from sunrise to sundown, you find yourself pushed to the limit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5152;After endless days, practising without pause, your final demonstration of your Firebending abilities leaves your instructors unimpressed.

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5152;That helps at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5157;Yes… Yes! I will atone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5159;Whatever pleases the Spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5160;It takes a while for the news to reach you, but apparently, people are surprised that [From.GetFirstName] has recently had a sudden change of heart, now treating a great many people better. It seems you have put the fear of the Spirits into [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5160;A good night's work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5161;[From.GetFullName] does not take your late night intrusion well, screaming for the guards before you have the chance to speak. You hear the thunder of boots approaching, and decide whether to abandon this mission or to finish it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5161;We'll do this the hard way then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5161;I will escape quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNSAK_5161_Win;You emerge victorious over [From.GetFullName]'s guards and punish [From.GetHerHim] for his insolence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNSAK_5161_Failure;You are defeated by [From.GetFullName]'s guards and have to make a hasty escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5162;Your guards charge into the bedroom. You watch in horror as the Spirit makes short work of them, smoke spilling through the room until the guards collapse to the ground, gasping for breath. The Spirit turns back to you, and begins to float towards you…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5162;I surrender! I'll do whatever you say!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5165;You move as the guards swarm in, creating plumes of smoke that weave with you through their spears. In seconds, the guards begin to collapse, unable to breath amongst the smoke. With them defeated, you turn back to your prey, who is now much more willing to hear what you have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5165;You will ATONE.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5163;Your guards storm into the room, raising spears the hooded figure. It explodes into a cloud of smoke, filling the room. When the smoke clears, the creature is gone, but a young guard shows you a bloodied spear tip.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5163;It's no Spirit, just some lunatic…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5166;Guards pour into the room, and you find yourself overwhelmed. You create a curtain of smoke, obscuring your escape, but one of the guard's manages to wound you on the way out. You crawl away, undiscovered, but injured and a failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5166;Curse my foolishness…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5164;Your guards pour into the room, pointing their spears at the hooded figure. Your mysterious intruder simply vanishes into a cloud of smoke. When it clears, they are nowhere to be seen. The guards search, but fail to find the attacker.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5164;No doubt just some lunatic…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5167;The guards charge in, but you make a quick escape, disappearing into a cloud of smoke before following your planned escape route. You disappear into the night, but sadly, you have failed your mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5167;I must be more prepared…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5168;You wake in a sudden to find a Spirit looming over you. The hooded figure looks down at you and speaks in an inhumanly deep voice: “[Root.GetFullName]. Have you forgotten your oath? Why do you not follow your lord and honour your ancestors?”;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5168;You are right, Spirit. I have an oath…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5168;Guards! Get here at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5168;I will do as you ask, wise Spirit…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5169;You sweep in a dead of night, waking [From.GetFullName] to demand [From.GetSheHe] fulfil his oath to his liege and follow the correct path. A bit of smoke and dark words and [From.GetSheHe] accepts you as a divine messenger, promising to obey. Content, you slip away into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5169;My work here is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5170;The following morning, you accept the divine message the Spirits brought you. You hurriedly proclaim to follow the Firelord's footsteps and embrace the path that our majesty as set out for the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5170;This is what's right…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5171;You awaken in the night to find a dark, hooded figure looming over you. Hovering in the air like a Spirit, it speaks in an inhuman voice: “[Root.GetFullName]. You have dishonoured your ancestors by forgetting your oaths. You must make amends.”;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5171;If the ancestors believe so…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5171;Guards! Get in here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5171;I will Spirit! I will honour my lord!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5172;You slip in at the dead of night, waking [From.GetFullName] to remind [From.GetHerHim] of [From.GetHerHis] duty to the ancestors. With some smoke and dark words, [From.GetFirstName] is ready to make amends for [From.GetHerHis] lack of loyalty. Content, you slip off into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5172;Remember that loyalty well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5173;The events of the previous night fresh in your memory, you write a letter to your liege, excusing for any lack of loyalty as of late and humbly offering up your future services if they are so needed. You must keep your oaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5173;I must be most diligent in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5174;[Root.GetFullName],\n\nAs your humble servant, I write to you to ask for forgiveness for any lapse in my service as your diligent vassal. If you so require it, I will answer any future requests of yours with the greatest haste.\n\nYour loyal servant, [From.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_MNSAK_5174;Odd, but not unwelcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opinion_kes_divine_ruler;Divine Ruler;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5175;One night, you have the strangest dream. A Spirit floats over your sleeping form, and in the voice of an angel asks: [Root.GetFullName]. Why do you sow unnecessary death and chaos among your people? Why not swear fealty to the Lord of Fire? Is your pride worth this suffering?”;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5175;This dream is an omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5175;Just some strange nightmare…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNSAK_5175_TOOLTIP;You will swear fealty to the Firelord and renounce your independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5176;Slipping in during the darkest night, you whisper words to [From.GetFullName] in [From.GetHerHis] sleep. Waking, [From.GetFirstName] is convinced [From.GetSheHe] has been visited by a divine vision for the future, and begins to do as you ask, preparing to pledge loyalty to the Fire Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5176;This is necessary for peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5177;You make preparations to travel to the great capital city of the Fire Nation, writing to the Firelord of your intent to swear fealty. The Firelord finds you sudden eagerness to join the growing Fire Nation strange, but readily accepts your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5177;The Firelord will lead us to a better future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5178;Without prelude, [From.GetFullName] arrives at your capital, offering fealty to the Fire Nation. [From.GetFirstName]'s reasoning is a bit strange, claiming to have a divine vision from the Spirits, but you readily accept this voluntary submission.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5178;It is not my place to question the Spirit's will.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5179;Slipping in during the darkest night, you whisper words to [From.GetFullName] in [From.GetHerHis] sleep. Waking, [From.GetFirstName] is troubled, but not convinced by the idea you planted. It seems you attempt to bring peace has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5232;A good day's work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5233;You are dragged before [From.GetFullName], who claims to have a letter detailing undeniable evidence of you're involvement with [From.Society.GetName]. Thankfully for you, [From.GetFullName] will be cleaning up those loose ends for you, lest [From.GetHerHis] own involvement becomes known. [From.GetSheHeCap] cautions you to be more careful in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5233;I'm thankful to have such well placed friends…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5234;It seems you investigation was for naught. Despite overwhelming evidence provided to [FromFrom.GetFullName], [From.GetFullName] has escaped any consequences. It seems [FromFrom.GetFullName] doesn’t trust your information, and has chosen not to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5234;So much time and effort, wasted…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5235;Recently, information has reached you that one of your courtiers, [From.GetFullName], is in fact a member of [From.Society.GetName]! To correct this travesty, you bring [From.GetHerHim] before you. The evidence is not compelling, but not acting on this may prove foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5235;If this is true, then I must deal with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5235;This is not proof enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_ICO_UE_DISAGRE;You do not trust this information, and choose to do nothing for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5235;Be more careful, will you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5236;It appears you may have been in some trouble, with [From.GetFullName] questioning you regarding your ties to [From.Society.GetName], with your quickly convince [From.GetHerHim] that whatever [From.GetSheHe] heard is but slanderous rumour. For now, [From.GetFirstName] appears to be willing to believe you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5236;A relief, to be sure…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5237;It appears your investigation was for naught, as all the evidence you've gathered is discretely provided doesn’t seem to be enough for [FromFrom.GetFullName] to be convinced that [From.GetFullName] has a nefarious agenda. To remain undetected, you must leave, your task unfinished.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5237;Curse them! I must do better next time…;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5061;Of course I'll join.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5067;The power is unimaginable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5068;The ability to channel raw Chi energy is usually not one that is learned, but after sitting for several weeks with masters of Combustion-Bending and painful days of receiving tattoos all over your body, you are ready.

EVTOPT_MNSAK_5087;I am close, that is true.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5088;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI write because I am watching your progress carefully.

EVTOPT_MNSAK_5047;It was beneficial, certainly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC601;As appointed leader of one of the four Air Temples, it is only fair that you sit on the Elder Council and have a voice in matters that concern all Air Nomads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.601;I appreciate this honour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC602;With one seat on the Elder Council empty, a new representative from that Air Temple has risen up to take it, [From.GetFullName]. The rest of the Council must wait and see if their voice is one of wisdom or one of disputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.602;We shall see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC603;You have decided to begin you search for one worthy enough to take your place. Over the coming weeks, you will observe many of the Temple's best, in hopes of finding one capable enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.603;Let the search commence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.603;I have changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606A;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is a talented speaker and mediator, and well travelled beyond the Air Temples. Surely, a charismatic individual such as [From.GetFirstName] may prove a worthy leader one day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606B;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is an Airbender without peer among [From.GetHerHis] generation and has demonstrated [From.GetHerHis] abilities far and wide. In these times, perhaps a more capable leader is what we may one day require.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606C;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is well renown as an organiser and one well versed in trade with outsiders. It is perhaps the Temple could benefit if led by such a keen custodian one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606D;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] isn't very social amongst [From.GetHerHis] peers, but always has a way of getting what [From.GetSheHe] wants. With proper guidance, it is perhaps [From.GetFirstName] may shape up into a proper leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC606E;After a week of searching, you have made good acquittance with a promising individual, by the name of [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is very knowledgeable about many things, both within and beyond the Temples, and has a clear talent for the Spiritual. [From.GetFirstName] definitely has the potential to be a great guide for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.606;[From.GetFirstName] is the right choice and a worthy successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.606;No, I must continue my search for another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NOMADEVTDESC607;You have sent your messengers far and wide to all other Temples, summoning their leaders to a Council meeting. Even as the most fast speeds, it will take some time until they all arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.607;We have much to discuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC608;After weeks of preparation, all Elders of the Council has arrived and assembled. As the one who first called the meeting, it should be up to you to decide what the first point of discussion should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC609;It appears that [From.GetFullName] has decided that the time has come again for a meeting of Elders from all Air Temples. It will take a few weeks to prepare, but surely, you'll be ready to attend this meeting of the Elder Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.609;I will definitely be there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.608;We must stand firmer against all threats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.608;We must withdraw ourselves more from the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADD.608;We must embrace our pacifistic traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADE.608;We must turn to a more pragmatic approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADF.608;We must better our trade with the wider world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADC.608;We must curtail trade to better protect ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC610;Weeks later, all members of the Council have assembled at [From.GetFullName]'s request. The meeting is prepared to begin, and as always, as the one who called the meeting, [From.GetFullName] will choose the first point of discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.610;Very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_aggression;We will start a vote to make our stance towards outsiders more pragmatic, loosening our code of pacifism in order to combat the severe threats we face. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. If the world is stable and trouble isn't apparent, we will have a difficult time convincing the Council to shift it's stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_isolation;We will start a vote to withdraw further from the outside world, avoiding conflict and even isolating ourselves from outsiders. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. If it is apparent that there are threats we cannot ignore, we will have a difficult time convincing the Council to shift it's stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_pacifism;We will start a vote to further promote our pacifistic ideals, shunning conflict and violence. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Naturally, Pacifistic Elders will favour this, while those who subscribe to other ideologies will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_nihilism;We will start a vote to embrace alternative ideologies, exploring our very small place in the world. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Naturally, Nihilistic Elders will favour this, while those who subscribe to other ideologies will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_trade;We will start a vote to again commit to trading with outsiders, bringing in many useful goods but also opening ourselves to outside threats. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Certain Councillors may favour this, while others might argue for a more distant approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_policy_to_protection;We will start a vote to close ourselves off from trading with outsiders, cutting the Temples off from foreign diseases and threats. This vote requires the agreement of a majority of the Council to pass. Certain Councillors may favour this, while others might argue for a more economical approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC611;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the increasing danger in the world, particularly that posed by outside threats. [From.GetFullName] argues that some of our most sacred customs must be relaxed in order to ensure continued peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.611;I agree, action must be taken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.611;I believe we must remain true to our ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_aggression;We will vote §Yyes§! to relaxing pacifistic traditions and embracing a more pragmatic policy. This will enable us to take more decisive action in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_aggression;We will vote §Yno§! to abandoning our pacifistic traditions, preferring to maintain the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC612A;It appears that the Council has agreed with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to embrace a more pragmatic approach when dealing with outside threats. Our customs will change to adapt with these trying times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC612B;It appears that the Council does not agree with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to maintain the status quo. It appears we will remain stagnant and still even in the face of great danger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.612;This will protect us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.612;The Council has made a serious mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_aggression;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_aggression_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to move towards more aggressive policy has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_aggression;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_aggression_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to move towards more aggressive policy has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC613;With [From.GetFullName] having said [From.GetHerHis] part, you now have a chance yourself to speak on an issue of your own choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADG.608;There is nothing I wish to discuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC616;With all matters of contention spoken and concluded, the time has come for the Council to part ways once again. All other members of the Council bid you farewell, thanking you for hosting this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.616;Hopefully we shall all meet again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC617;All matters before the Council appear to be settled for now, and the time has come to return home. All members of the Council thank [From.GetFullName] gratefully for hosting this meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.617;I bid you all farewell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC618;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the need for us Air Nomads to continue to protect our way of life and most valued traditions by withdrawing further from the world and conflict. By isolating ourselves, we avoid conflict with other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.618;I agree, we must abandon conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.618;I believe our current policy is best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC619A;It appears that the Council has agreed with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to isolate ourselves further. This will lead to greater peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC619B;It appears that the Council does not agree with your views, and the majority has voted in agreement to maintain the status quo. It appears they are quite content with the inherent risks of dealing with outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.619;This protects our most sacred beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.619;We've sacrificed our ideals today. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_isolation;We will vote §Yyes§! to isolating ourselves further, for our own good. This action will help our people stabilise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_isolation;We will vote §Yno§! to isolating ourselves from the wider world, preferring to maintain the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_isolation;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_isolation_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to distance ourselves from the other nations has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_isolation;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_isolation_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to move towards a more isolationist policy has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC620;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the everlasting philosophical debate concerning the very principles our people are built upon and have cherished for countless generations. [From.GetFullName] argues we don't that these ideals seriously enough, and that we should further embrace and hold to our Pacifistic ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.620;We are in agreement with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.620;No, I feel we do those ideals service enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC621A;The Council has agreed that our Pacifistic ideals must be further embraced, and have chosen to continue to take new action to promote and uphold our most sacred traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC621B;The Council seems to have not agreed, choosing to do nothing to counter the erosion of our most sacred traditions. It seems they are content to sit idle for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.621;I'm glad the Council sees my wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.621;They may idle, but I will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_pacifism;We will vote §Yyes§! to further entrenching Pacifist ideals across Air Nomad lands, countering alternative philosophies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_pacifism;We will vote §Yno§! to any further spread of Pacifistic ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_pacifism;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_pacifism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread the wisdom of Pacifism has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_pacifism;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_pacifism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread Pacifistic ideals has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC622;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council,  and that is the lack of alternative philosophies, particularly those who imagine a different way of thinking that our more traditional approach. [From.GetFullName] argues we should continue to promote this school of thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.622;We will choose to promote these alternative ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.622;No, we shall never promote this alternative, Nihilistic approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC623A;The Council has agreed that alternative viewpoints need to be embraced, giving us the freedom to further spread our wisdom. More and more everyday see the truth in our ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC623B;The Council has remained stubborn, refusing to give space to alternative view points, intent on remaining close-minded and grasping onto the comforting ideals of tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.623;It is most excellent they agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.623;The fools are simply close-minded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_nihilism;We will vote §Yyes§! to further embracing alternative, more pragmatic philosophies, spreading these ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_nihilism;We will vote §Yno§! to abandoning sacred tradition to promote these foolish, Nihilistic ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_nihilism;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_nihilism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread the knowledge of Nihilism has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_nihilism;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_nihilism_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to further spread the knowledge of Nihilism has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC624;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, that being the continued trade between our people and other nations. [From.GetFullName] believes we could further promote this, bringing more outsider traders and merchant to our shores. They believe it will improve trade, but others point out it may bring other outsider ills to our homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.624;More trade will benefit us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.624;I do not think it wise to further trade with outsiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC625A;The Council is in agreement that more trade will be better for all peoples, Air Nomad and outsiders alike. With this motion, more traders and merchants will be able to visit our lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC625B;The Council has decided to disagree with the idea of further embracing trade, deciding that the ills of outsiders are too great to be allowed in close proximity of our homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.625;It is good we all see the good outcomes of trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.625;Our lives could all be so much better if they weren’t so foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_trade;We will vote §Yyes§! to promoting trade between ourselves and the outside world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_trade;We will vote §Yno§! to opening ourselves to risk by allowing outsiders unnecessarily close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_pass_trade;The vote passes with §Y[global_cp_trade_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to promote trade and further enrich our lives has succeeded. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_fail_pass_trade;The vote has failed to pass with §Y[global_cp_trade_vote.GetValue]§! votes. The vote to promote trade has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC626;[From.GetFullName] brings an issue before the Council, and that is the trade between our Temples and outsiders, particularly how it leaves us vulnerable to outsider disease and ills. The suggestion is that we further clamp down on trade, better protecting us even if it means closing ourselves off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.626;I agree, we must choose safety over comfort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.626;I disagree, we need trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC627A;The Council have agreed with your stance, and have passed a motion to cease all trade with outsiders merchants. This will further protect our Temples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC627B;The Council does not agree with your line of thought, choosing to continue trading with outsiders and ignoring the dangers it brings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.627;This is no doubt the wise course of action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.627;They have left us vulnerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_yes_to_protection;We will vote §Yyes§! to restricting trade between our Temples and the outside world, protecting us from harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cp_vote_no_to_protection;We will vote §Yno§! to closing down trade with the outside world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

spirit_world_peaceful_desc;The relations between Man and Spirit are relatively peaceful. Peace is kept between the two worlds, and incidents are rare and far between. Humanity respects the Spirits, and it is sometimes said that benevolent Spirits may aid Humanity in turn. Meanwhile, the most dangerous and hostile of Spirits remain dormant within the Spirit World itself, content with their realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

spirit_world_chaotic_desc;Chaos reigns as tensions between the physical and spiritual worlds erupt into open conflict. Humanity has forgotten it's respect for the Spirits, and in turn, hostile Spirits lash out, sometimes wiping out entire settlements. Malevolent Spirits actively prowl for prey, their activities unnoticed in the chaos. As the world further slides into crisis, the Era of Light becomes dangerously close to ending. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

spirit_world_harmonic_convergence_desc;Every ten thousand years, an event known as Harmonic Convergence occurs when the two worlds are the closest and the barrier between them is at it's weakest.

spirit_world_age_of_uncertainty_desc;The Great Warlord, Chin the Conqueror, has fallen in battle against Avatar Kyoshi. His empire crumbles, torn apart by greedy generals and nobles. Ba Sing Se's power over the continent seems to have been restored, but even that is endangered as the Earth Kingdom considers further centralising it's power. In the midst of all of this, the Avatar is yet again inactive, watching and waiting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Earth King's disastrous attempts to centralise power has the entire nation up in arms. As commoners revolt against infeasible taxes in Ba Sing Se, the last warlords of Chin find themselves fighting a desperate last stand to keep their territories.

spirit_world_age_of_smoke_and_shadow_desc;As the chaotic period of rebellion in the Earth Kingdom ends, great change is occurring in the Fire Isles, as land once divided between countless petty rulers since the fall of the Sun Kingdom, start to unite into larger, more orderly realms. As more and more of Isles changes, the tribal warlords in the eastern regions of Isles fight an increasingly desperate fight to survive, resorting to brutal and iron-fisted rule. The blood of innocents flows in the Isles, and even the Spirits grow restless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

New discoveries combined with the plentiful fuel of Firebending have created industry never thought possible.

spirit_world_age_of_aggression_desc;Fuelled by rapid economic growth, the Fire Nation has attained great power. That growth wanes now as the Fire Nation reaches the maximum potential of it's natural resources. However, it has not idled with this wealth, building a large and powerful military force. Now, the Fire Nation eyes the resource rich lands of the Earth Kingdom, seizing ports on the Western Coast and establishing settlements. The Earth Kingdom is slow to wake, but the presence of these colonies have begun to send waves of outrage and panic in the Earth Kingdom that may one day erupt into open war...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

With the arrival of the Great Comet, the Fire Nation attacked, setting itself against all other nations. The Comet's wake has left massive devastation across the Earth Kingdom, leaving it weakened before the unstoppable march of the Firebenders. The Earth Kingdom faces a grave crisis, and those yet to be drawn into the conflict must begin to pick a side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

spirit_world_age_of_hostility_desc;The War between the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom continues on, decades of endless battles and skirmishes. The conflict now ensnares the entire known world, and global trade has come to a halt. Wherever the battlefield goes, desolation and ruin follow in it's wake.  As the losses mount, all grow weary. To stop this, the Fire Nation turns its attention away from traditional tactics towards it's most powerful strength: it's industrial might, producing mighty war machines powered by Firebending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

All of this in the shadow of the Great Comet itself, once again returning to soar through the world's skies and leave devastation in it's wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

spirit_world_age_of_disharmony_desc;The Hundred Year War is over, and the world has returned to a tenuous peace. While both Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom have agreed to peace and the return of occupied territory, few believe this treaty will last. Some even plot against what they see as a great betrayal of their people. It is without a doubt, even if the war does end, it will not be without further bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

More so, the industry the Fire Nation once closely guarded now spreads to the rest of the world, triggering great change and economic renewal. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spirit_world_age_of_progress;Age of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spirit_world_age_of_progress_desc;The world has changed greatly, with an entire generation who never knew the era of the Hundred Year War rising to prominence. It is an era of technology and industry, as Spiritual traditions lay forgotten. This change has not all been for the better however, as with great wealth has come great poverty as the divide between cultures, classes, benders and non-benders, becomes wider than ever. With the bloodshed of endless war a distant memory, the world once against shifts towards hatred and chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
