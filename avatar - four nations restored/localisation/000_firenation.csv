sw_1_desc;In the glory days, the Sun Warriors rode into battle atop mighty Dragons, a powerful and deadly partnership. Our successes on the battlefield may have finally brought forth a warrior from your ranks worthy of a Dragon's respect, and a powerful new asset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sw_2_desc;The ancient Kingdom of the Sun Warriors once spanned the Fire Isles and beyond. If we are to take the first step forward to reclaiming our ancestor's glory, we must recreate their achievement, conquering the territories where their strongholds used to stand. Only then can we truly claim the Eternal Flame burns brighter than all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdesc.900;After days of work, your best craftsmen presents you with a splendid crown, restored from it's ancient form. Though many marvel at it's splendidness, while others scowl at your attempt to recapture long-past glory, it is clear this crown shall serve as a reminder of your people's great heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELtitle.901;Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.901;In a spectacular reversal of fortunes, the Sun Warriors have finally emerged from their decline into extinction, pressing forth to recapture several lost territories. News of these battles is spreading far and wide. This is a shock to many, especially to those beyond the Fire Isles who believed the ancient people a myth. Is is without a doubt now however, that the Eternal Flame shines bright once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.901;May our new realm last as long as the Flame itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.901;Bah, these fool's empire started declining for a reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptC.901;What an interesting people, these Sun Warriors are...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdesc.902;As shocking as their initial resurgence from extinction, the Sun Warriors have fought on to forge themselves a new empire to rival their ancestors. It can be truly said that there is a new power in this world, that power being the Empire of the Sun. Only time will tell how far the Sun Warrior's new found power will take them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.902;Our people have once again reclaimed their rightful place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ATLABI_EVTDESC_4;After the commotion of the past few, the reality has finally begun to set in. You have a son, [From.GetFirstName]. You wonder, and secretly hope, if [From.GetFirstName] will be one of the first Airbender's born in over a century, but only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLABI_4;You are special to us no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.4;Joyous news has reached you today. While the Sages may have assured you that the royal bloodline was well assured, the news that Prince Iroh, has finally created fire has put all unsaid anxieties as ease. As long as those within the line of succession continue to bend fire, Agni continues to shine his blessings upon our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.4;Fantastic news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.5;As you are well aware, being born to one day ascend to the position of Firelord is a far more challenging destiny than it seems. Your son and heir, Iroh, has however continued to succeed beyond such lofty expectations. Numerous tutors and instructors report that the prince shows great promise, a diligent student as well as a natural Firebender. It is clear he is meant for greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.5;We are blessed to have such a son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_B.5;There are a great many more things a future Firelord requires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.6;Today, the young Prince Iroh gave a demonstration of his Firebending abilities. While the young Prince is no master just yet, he shows clear promise to further develop his abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.6;I am pleased with the Prince's progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.7;Prince Iroh has once again demonstrated his Firebending abilities before the royal court, impressing many with his skill and strength. Before, the young Prince showed promised, but it is now clear that if he continues to hone his skills, he may become one of the greatest Firebenders seen in the royal family since Firelord Sozin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.7;Most excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.8;While conflict rages elsewhere around the world, the young Prince Iroh has dutifully continued his studies. As the Fire Nation continues to battle it's enemies abroad, it was always certain that one day Prince Iroh would need lead an army into battle. So far, it seems he has learned well from the many tacticians and strategists in the royal court, as well as showing a keen interest in the tactics of our enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.8;To destroy the Earthbenders, one must destroy their walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_B.8;To destroy the Earthbenders, one must attack relentlessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.9;A celebration was held today in the royal palace to commemorate Prince Iroh, who has finally completed his studies. He has learned well, emerging as a promising strategist who well no doubt serve you well. Before he joins the army abroad however, Prince Iroh asks you one favour, and that is to journey to Aztlan, ancient home of the Sun Warriors, so that he may prove his mettle as a Firebender by slaying the Dragons that are rumoured to still inhabit the ruins there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.9;Go my Prince, if there are still Dragons there, you will surely slay them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.10;After a lengthy journey to Aztlan, Prince Iroh has made a late return without his escort, but never the less victorious. He reports a successful hunt, slaying the last Dragons of Aztlan, dearly guarded by the Sun Warriors there. None dare question the feat, especially after Prince Iroh demonstrates even more magnificent Firebending than when he first left. It is a great day of pride the Prince proves himself worthy of the title of Dragon, perhaps the last Firebender to ever do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.10;To Prince Iroh, Dragon of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_DESC.11;You have been told today that it has indeed been proved that Ozai is indeed a Firebender, as is expected of a Prince of the Fire Nation. It is trivial news, but news none the less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ZEATLA_OPT_A.11;All is as should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

String_WeaponMaster;Though not able to bend the elements, your opponent's reputation as a masterful warrior is likely little exaggeration. This may prove to be a difficult battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_StrongNonbender;Though not able to bend the elements, from a mere glance you can observe that your opponent has a powerful physique. That may make them quite the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_Nonbender;Your opponent is never to be underestimated, but you know your opponent lacks both the ability to bend and any notable training. This fight shouldn't be too difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.3;It appears that [challenger.GetFullName] has grown tired of civilities and has the gall to challenge you in combat. The messenger bringing this demand gives notice of place, time and term of this duel. Any weapon or ability, including bending, is permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.3;It appears that [challenger.GetFullName] has grown tired of civilities and has the gall to challenge you in combat. The messenger bringing this demand gives notice of place, time and term of this duel. Any weapon or ability is permitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.3;If [challenger.GetFullName] wants a fight, I will happily give it to [challenger.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.3;I will not engage in such violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptC.3;Such violence is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.4;As you prepare to issue a formal challenge to [From.GetFullName], your advisors are quick to point out that since your opponent lacks the bending abilities you so obviously wield, they would face no dishonour refusing your challenge. [From.GetFullName] would perhaps accept more readily if the terms dictated a fair fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.4;My abilities only prove my superiority. No terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.4;Very well, I will make the shame more unbearable. Offer such terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptC.4;Actually, I changed my mind. There shall be no challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.5;It appears that [From.GetFullName] has grown tired of civilities and has the gall to challenge you in combat. More disgracefully, your opponent does so knowing they have the undeniable advantage of [From.GetHerHis] bending abilities. Nobody would think it cowardly to refuse such an unfair fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.5;If [From.GetSheHe] wants a fight, a fight I will give [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.5;I won't be baited by this dishonourable challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The messenger bringing this demand gives notice of place, time and term of this duel. In the name of fairness, [From.GetFullName] will refrain from using [From.GetHerHis] bending abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.7;I am ready for this battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.8;It seems [From.GetFullName] has decided shame and disgrace and a worthy price for survival. With the confirmation of [From.GetHerHis] dishonour, you have triumphed over your opponent with little more than words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.8;Words are all it takes to defeat cowards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.9;In response to your challenge, [From.GetFullName] has apparently only mocked you, branding you unworthy of [From.GetHerHis] abilities. Usually, to refuse such a duel would constitute grave dishonour, but the only words you hear whispered out of sight is that you were lucky [From.GetFullName] didn't accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.9;This is a grievous insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.10;In response to your challenge, [From.GetFullName] has apparently only mocked you, branding you a coward for refusing to face [From.GetHerHim] without the use of your bending abilities. Hiding behind [From.GetHerHis] lack of such talents seems to have spared [From.GetFullName] from any dishonour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.10;There'll come a day where [From.GetSheHe] won't be able to hide behind excuses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.12;It seems [From.GetFullName] isn't afraid to meet your challenge, accepting your terms. All that remains now is to travel out and meet [From.GetHerHim] on the arranged duelling ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.12;I've been looking forward to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.13;The time to duel has arrived. Under terms, you and [From.GetFullName] will battle until either combatant is defeated or yields. Until then, none can interfere. The duel soon commences, and [From.GetFullName] strides forth. [From.GetDuelistCapabilities];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.14;You and your opponent continue to stand firm, ready to fight. In this moment, you must decide your move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELoptE.14;Now is the time to end this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.15;With this window of opportunity, you can surprise your opponent with a devastating attack with the use of your abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.15;I was wrong. I must simply attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.15;I must use my Earthbending to my advantage and break them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescA.16;Your opponent's makes a small, but devastating misstep, allowing you to close the distance. Your weapon strikes true, and [hostile.GetFirstName]'s blood is shed. [hostile.GetFullName] manages to recover, staggering back and out of reach, but the damage is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.16;Your opponent falters, staggering and you use the chance to launch a devastating Earthbending attack, kicking a pillar of rock at your opponent. The missile strikes true and [hostile.GetFirstName]'s barely avoids being crushed by it. [hostile.GetFullName] manages to recover, dodging your follow up attack, but the damage is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescC.16;Your opponent slips, leaving [hostile.GetHerselfHimself] open to attack for a split second, which you use to sweep downward, unleashing a devastating wave of fire. Your opponent staggers back, burnt by the flames. [hostile.GetFullName] manages to recover from the serious wounds, dodging your follow up attack, but the damage is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescD.16;With a single motion, you use your bending to sweep your opponent from [hostile.GetHerHis] feet with a wave of water, before striking them again with a high pressured blast. Your opponent rolls across the floor, before coming to a stop. [hostile.GetFullName] manages to stagger back to [hostile.GetHerHis] feet, but the damage is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.16;When your opponent shows a momentary lapse in concentration, you strike, sending out a blast of air that sends them flying backward. Pressing the attack, you sweep them upward before slamming them down into the ground. [hostile.GetFullName] manages to stagger back to [hostile.GetHerHis] feet, but the damage is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescC.17;You make a sweeping motion, creating a burning wall of fire rushing towards your enemy. [hostile.GetFullName] is caught with nowhere to go, and is forced to defend against the flames. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescD.17;You strike your opponent with a watery limb before freezing it, trapping them in place. You follow up the attack, sending water barreling towards them before freezing it mid-flight. Frozen to the spot, [hostile.GetFullName] is forced to face the attack head on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.17;You strafe your opponent, carrying the wind with you. With a pulling motion, you pull them off their feet with a gust of air, before striking again with an even more powerful attack. Stunned, [hostile.GetFullName] is hit directly by the blast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.18;You close in on your enemy, attempting several strikes against them. [hostile.GetFullName] is hard pressed defending [hostile.GetHerselfHimself], unable to block or evade your attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.18;You use your bending to raise a pillar out of the ground, before breaking it apart and launching the debris at your opponent. Your opponent is hard pressed to dodge them, and is struck several times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescD.18;You draw upon the water around you, creating several tendrils before sending them towards your opponent. [hostile.GetFullName] sees them coming, smashing tendrils apart before a few solidify into ice and impact, sending [hostile.GetHerHim] staggering back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.18;At range with your opponent, you empower the winds to rush towards them. [hostile.GetFullName] sees your attack coming, and prepares [hostile.GetHerselfHimself] as the blasts hit, sending [hostile.GetHerHim] flying back onto the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescE.20;You continue to use your Airbending to weave and evade attacks, but you fail to find any openings to counter yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.21;A momentary lapse has [From.GetFullName] close in on you, striking several blows you barely manage to survive. You stagger back, barely managing to evade further attacks and recover. The damage is done though, as you feel blood roll across your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.21;A misplaced step causes you to falter, and [From.GetFullName] takes full advantage, using Earthbending to kick a pillar of rock towards you. It hits you head on, and your sent flying onto your back. As you stagger back up, barely evading the follow up attack, you taste blood in your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescC.21;Your opponent catches you off-guard, creating a wave of fire towards you feet. Caught by the attack, you stagger backwards, beating out the fire on your robes. You recover, but you feel the pain of your skin blistering beneath the heat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescD.21;Your opponent hits you with a wave of water that sweeps you off your feet. [From.GetFullName] follows up the attack, hitting you with a high pressured blast that sends you flying back. You stumble back to your feet, feeling your body ache with pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescD.22;One of your enemy's watery limbs catches you, freezing your feet to the ground. Before you can free yourself, [From.GetFullName] sends a high pressured blast of water barreling towards you. Trapped, you are struck with the full force of the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.22;Your opponent continues to strafe you, before striking out. A gust of air sweeps you off your feet, before [From.GetFullName] attacks you again with another blast of air. Stunned, you are hit by the full force of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.23;Your opponent charges towards you, swinging repeatedly with their weapon. You find yourself hard-pressed to endure the attack, and [From.GetFullName] manages to land several glancing strikes against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.23;Your opponent raises a pillar out of the ground, before shattering it with a kick and sending the remains flying at you. Rocks fly everywhere, and several of various sizes manage to hit you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdescD.23;Your opponent sprouts watery tendrils from [From.GetHerHis] arms, before sending them flying towards you. You strike out against them, shattering a few back into droplets before other tendrils reach you, solidifying into ice, some shattering against you and others cutting into you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.23;Your opponent charges you, sending forward several gusts of wind that send you flying off your feet and impacting against the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.24;Your opponent attacks, but you are ready, evading or blocking several strikes from [From.GetFullName]'s weapon. You strafe sideways, escaping the assault with only minor injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.24;Your opponent slams a foot down, creating a rolling wave through the stone floor beneath you as if it was water. The wave hits you, throwing you in the air and onto the ground. You roll back to your feet, mostly unhurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescC.24;Your opponent closes in, punching and kicking fire towards you. You move back, evading most of your enemy's flurry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescD.24;Your opponent continues to bend water, forming wave after wave to send crashing towards you. You endure the blunt impact of the water hitting you, powering forward to close in with your enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.24;Your opponent throws both hands together, creating a blast of air that causes you to stagger backwards. Recovering from only being momentarily stunned, you fight on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescA.25;Your opponent takes several misjudged swings with their weapon, all of them you easily evade or block.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescB.25;Your opponent sweeps an arm upward, sending several stones from the floor flying towards you. All of them either miss or impact harmlessly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescC.25;Your opponent closes in, attempting to strike you physically with blows empowered with burning fire, but you manage to evade them, backing out of range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescD.25;You take cover as your opponent bends a puddle of water into the air, before freezing and sending the icicles raining down upon you. They shatter harmlessly against your shelter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdescE.25;You continue to press forward, refusing to give your opponent the advantage. Your enemy continues to use Airbending to move around you, weaving past your attacks but unable to find the time to strike back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.26;You choose not to attack, instead keeping your distance. You watch and wait for your enemy to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.27;Your opponent chooses not to attack, instead keeping distance and adopting a defensive stance. It is clear your enemy is waiting for you to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.16;A fatal mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.17;This battle shouldn't last longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.18;An adequate strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.19;I need to strike truer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.19;Damn them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.20;Dammit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.21;I must fight on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.22;This I'll survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.22;I'm barely scratched!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.23;That was painful§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.23;I've survived worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.24;A mere wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.24;I'm unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.25;I must press this advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.26;The best offence is defence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.26;Counter-attack [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.27;It makes this all the easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_ATK_EARTHBENDER_TOOLTIP;The trait §YEarthbender§!, enables you to use the §YEarthquake§! ability a single time per battle for the cost of stamina, adopting a style of attack that denies your enemy any cover or retreat.

ADUEL_ATK_LIGHTNING_TOOLTIP;The trait §YLightningbender§!, enables you to use the §YLightning Strike§! ability for the cost of stamina, allowing you a chance to deliver fatal damage to an enemy. Beware however, your enemy may redirect your attack if they too are capable of this ability. If successful, this ability will strike your opponent for §R100§! critical damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.29;You adopt a much more aggressive style, pressing forward and slamming a foot to shake the ground itself. You bend the rock beneath you, not pulling up walls between you and your opponent, but causing them to rise up around them, trapping them in your sights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.29;They'll be an easier target, now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.30;Your opponent takes a much more aggressive approach with [From.GetHerHis] earthbending, beginning to abandon defending [From.GetHerselfHimself] and instead focusing on bending earthen walls out of the ground to surround you. Overcome by this, you become more exposed to your opponent's attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.30;I can withstand this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_EARTHQUAKE_HIT_TOOLTIP;Your opponent uses their §YEarthbending§! abilities, permanently lowering your §BDefence§! by §R-1§! for the remainder of the battle, in addition to decreasing your chance of evading enemy attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.28;Beaten, [From.GetFullName] collapses to the ground before you. All can see that this battle has come to a close, with you as the rightful victor! [From.GetFullName] looks up at you, awaiting [From.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.28;This was an honourable battle. You may go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.28;I will show you no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptC.28;Now, you are my prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptD.28;Suffering will teach you your place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptE.28;A good duel, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.31;[From.GetFullName] strikes you again, and this time you cannot endure anything more. You collapse to the ground, and find yourself unable to rise again, only succeeding at staggering onto your knees. You look up to see [From.GetFullName] standing over you and yourself at their mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.31;I do not fear§.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUEL_EXECUTE_ENEMY;You will kill [hostile.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUEL_SPAR_ENEMY;You have concluded your spar with [hostile.GetFullName], emerging victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.32;It seems [From.GetFullName] is not a merciful opponent. You fall to the ground, tired, beaten and unable to muster any strength as [From.GetFullName] stands over you, preparing to deal the final blow§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.32;I accept my defeat. I am at peace with that§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.32;You are nothing but dishonourable scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptC.32;I swear, my kin will make you pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.33;After you fall to your knees, defeated, [From.GetFullName] declares you a prisoner. Dishonourably captured by your opponent, time will only tell what fate has waiting for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.33;One day I'll get you back for this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.34;Crumbling to your knees, beaten, you look up to see [From.GetFullName] standing over you. There is no hint of mercy in [From.GetHerHis] cruel gaze. [From.GetSheHeCap] reaches out to your face with a hand still burning...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.34;ARRRGGGHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.35;Defeated, all that is left for you to crumble to your knees and await your fate. [From.GetFullName] stands over you, but [From.GetSheHe] does not raise a hand against you. Instead, [From.GetSheHe] offers it, choosing to leave you be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.35;I thank you for your mercy§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.35;How dare you humiliate me! Pretend I'm not a threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.36;[From.GetFullName] remains standing, emerging victorious from this duel. You rise to your feet, and as custom, bow to your opponent, [From.GetFullName] returning the gesture. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.36;This was an honourable exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.37;In the face of death, [From.GetFullName] shows no dishonour, remaining still as you strike the final blow. With [From.GetFullName] dead, you walk forth from the duelling ground the undisputed victor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.37;[From.GetFullName] has been dealt with, that's all that matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptB.37;I emerge stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.38;In the face of death, [From.GetFullName] does not go quietly, cursing your name and promising retribution. With the final blow, the insults and threats are silenced and the duel ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.38;I'll take my chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.39;Your men quickly move forward, securing [From.GetFullName] are dragging them from the field. The battle is done, and you return homeward with [From.GetFullName] as your prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.39;This will be the end of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.40;You strike, fire flowing forth and over [From.GetFullName]. Screaming, [From.GetFullName] falls to the ground, burnt by the flames vicious heat. [From.GetFullName] is dragged away alive, but never the less scarred forever by your hand, a permanent mark of dishonour. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.40;I've taught you your place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.41;[From.GetFullName] seems surprised at your mercy, but accepts it, rising to [From.GetHerHis] feet and bowing. Whatever ill will between you seems forgotten in this act of mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.41;There is nothing more between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.42;Despite your show of mercy, [From.GetFullName] remains knelling on the ground, clear disgust on [From.GetHerHis] face. You walk away, leaving them disgraced, unworthy of even killing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.42;Consider this a final insult to you, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.43;You offer [From.GetFullName] your hand, and [From.GetSheHe] takes it, and you pull [From.GetHerHim] back to [From.GetHerHis] feet. You and your opponent bow, ending this exercise. When you rise, [From.GetFullName] nods, respectful of your victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.43;We both grow stronger for our trials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.44;You ground yourself, adapting the stance that will allow you to channel electricity through your body as you clench a hand into a fist. Feeling the power surging, allow your fingers to curl outward, crackling with energy, before releasing it completely in the direction of your enemy. A lightening bolt erupts from the tip of your finger, rocketing towards your opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUEL_ATK_LIGHTENING_CRIT_TOOLTIP;your attack connects with your opponent, dealing massive damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdesc.46;[From.GetFullName] ceases attack for a second, before you notice a crackling in the air. You have a mere moment to dodge before [From.GetFullName] unleashes lightning itself towards you. The attack misses, exploding against the ground behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.46;A lucky escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.47;[From.GetFullName] doesn§t attempt to evade as you direct the attack, instead catching it with one hand before channelling it through the body, then unleashing it back at you. You have no time to react as your own lightning hits you dead on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.47;Oh§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.48;[From.GetFullName] is struck by the redirected lightning, the energy hitting dead on. For a slight second, [From.GetFullName] sways, before collapsing to the ground, dead. Silence washes over everyone around. The duel is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELoptA.53;This will be of use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.54;You are surprised when [From.GetFullName] firebends, not at you, but at the ground, creating a billowing cloud of smoke that envelops the arena. You are left coughing and stumbling in the cloud, disoriented by this sudden attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ADUELdesc.79;[From.GetFullName] barely manages to scramble away from the fury of your volcanic eruption, getting badly burnt with the sheer heat radiating from the flowing lava. It is clear this attack has proved crippling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.79;Ha! Getting warmer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.80;Your opponent proves evermore deadly, slamming a foot down and the earth beneath you shattering. You leap away in time as the ground where you once should erupts into a miniature volcano, lava spewing forth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.80;A narrow escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.81;[From.GetFullName] somehow manages to act before the eruption hits, diving away before being caught in the sheer heat radiating from the lava now flowing from the earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.81;How!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.82;You decide to deliver a quick end to this battle, controlling the air around your opponent and beginning to bend it, funnelling all the air out of the area around them. Trapped within this vacuum, [From.GetFullName] begins to struggle§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.82;A little longer§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.83;You are taken by surprise when [From.GetFullName] sweeps you off your feet with a blast of Airbending, before suddenly creating a twister around you. Trapped within, you slowly begin to choke in this vacuum, barely able to break free in time before you suffocate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.83;§.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.84;[From.GetFullName] finally goes limp, and you release your hold of the air. [From.GetFullName] hits the ground and stays there, before suddenly coughing and once again breathing in. Alive, but barely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.84;As you see, you've already lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.85;You are taken by surprise when [From.GetFullName] sweeps you off your feet with a blast of Airbending, before suddenly creating a twister around you. You manage to break free, striking back at [From.GetFullName] and ending this gruesome attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.85;Don't try that again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.86;[From.GetFullName] struggles against your hold, managing to break free from the vacuum and counter attack. You are forced to evade, ending your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.86;You shall not be so lucky next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.87;It is time to make this battle a little more equal. You furiously attack, a flurry of punches and picks, aiming to cripple your opponent at their most vulnerable points.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.87;This should slow you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.88;[From.GetFullName] suddenly strikes out, with a flurry of punches and kicks. You stagger backwards, stunned by the attack. Your limbs feel numb, and your bending seems§ weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.88;I'll fight on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.89;[From.GetFullName] suddenly strikes out, with a flurry of punches and kicks. You manage to evade the brunt of the attack, with only minor wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.89;You'll need to try harder than that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.90;Drawing your weapon, you charge towards [From.GetFullName]. You swing several heavy blows, intending to cripple your opponent and turn the odds of this battle even further in your favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.90;You won't be a threat much longer§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.91;[From.GetFullName] draws a weapon, and before you know it, begins raining down heavy blows upon you. You barely evade some swings, others landing with crippling effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.91;I must fight through the pain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.92;[From.GetFullName] draws a weapon, and before you know it, begins raining down heavy blows upon you. You duck and dodge every swing, managing to avoid the crippling blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.92;Speed wins out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.93;The time has come to swiftly defeat your opponent. You pull the toxic dart you prepared earlier, careful not to touch the crippling poison on its tip, and throw it, sending it flying towards [From.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.93;You won't endure this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.94;You're caught by surprise when [From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a dart, flinging it towards you. It impacts on your arm, and you quickly pull it out. It is too late however, for you already feel the poison flowing through your body§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.94;Curse you, you venomous snake! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.95;You're caught by surprise when [From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a dart, flinging it towards you. You barely manage to sidestep it in time, as the poisonous dart flies past you. A close call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.95;No more tricks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.96;The time has come to use your very special skills. Pulling out one of the explosive charges you prepared earlier, you light the fuse and pitch it towards [From.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.96;Dodge this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.97;[From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a metal cannister, lighting a fuse and pitching it towards you. You leap, but the explosive ignites and catches you in its blast. You feel the heat and fury of its detonation as you are flung backwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.97;I'll live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.98;[From.GetFullName] suddenly produces a metal cannister, lighting a fuse and pitching it towards you. You leap just in time as the explosive device detonates, and you roll away, feeling the heat of the blast, but escaping unharmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.98;Your bombs won't stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.99;Its time to end this battle! Clasping your hands together, you block out your worldly surroundings and focus. Channelling the energies within you, you enter the Avatar State, your eyes shining white. [From.GetFullName] steps back, stunned by your power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.99;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.100;You turn and see [From.GetFullName]'s eyes suddenly begin to shine white. Streams of rock, water and fire forming around them, they levitate up into the air. Awestruck by the Avatar's sheer power, you cannot escape its wrath as the Avatar strikes the ground, sending you flying back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.100;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.101;You slam down into the earth, sending [From.GetFullName] flying back. You fly through the air, landing not far away. FROM is struck by your power, and cannot stand against it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.101;It's over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.102;You turn and see [From.GetFullName]'s eyes suddenly begin to shine white. Streams of rock, water and fire forming around them, they levitate up into the air. You react, quickly evading incoming boulders thrown towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELoptA.102;I can hold out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ADUELdesc.103;You slam down into the earth, sending [From.GetFullName] flying back. You fly through the air, landing not far away. FROM is struck by your power, but stands up, ready to fight on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4514;I do agree, things could be better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4514;I sadly don't share your feelings on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4515_A;I approached [From.GetTitledFirstName] at a shrine recently, speaking to [From.GetHerHim] on length about the injustices within our nation. [From.GetTitledFirstName] Seems to approve of my statements and the ideals of our Society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_MNSAK_4515;I see you are comfortable with ignorance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4516;[kemurikage_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] Goes one step further, asking you whether you believe it would be just for one to do the right thing even if the realm's law forbids it. Whether or not you would be willing to take justice into your own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4516;If I had no other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4516;That is not for me to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_MNSAK_4517;If you cannot do so, then we are done talking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4518;[kemurikage_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] turns to you now and asks if you really could put words into action. She asks if you have ever heard of the Kemurikage Sisterhood, an order dedicated to preserving justice and order in the Fire Isles, and if you're willing to learn more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4518;I'll accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The original Kemurikage were Spirits of Vengeance who extracted a heavy price from the cruel warlords of the Fire Isles. Now, the Sisterhood does the same, punishing the wicked and preserving the stability of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4521;Most intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4522;Finally, [kemurikage_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] introduces you to [grand_master.GetTitledFirstName], Grandmaster of the Sisterhood. She asks you whether or not you are finally ready to pledge your loyalty to the Sisterhood and the protection of the Fire Isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4524;Thank you, Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4525;You leave, hurrying from the Shrine and leaving the Sisterhood behind. They silently watching you go from behind their masks, and you cannot help but think you will indeed suffer if you ever divulge what happened here today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4535;All of this is intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4535_TOOLTIP;You continue your efforts to join the §YEnlightened§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4536;Finally, you reach an impossible grove amidst the lifeless tundra. Here, [enlightened_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] leads you before a shimmering light. It is here another visitor emerges from the forest, [grand_master.GetTitledFirstName] introducing [grand_master.GetHerselfHimself]. [grand_master.GetSheHeCap] tells you this light used to be a portal between worlds, until the ignorance of the Avatar destroyed it. [grand_master.GetSheHeCap] asks you if you are willing to do whatever it takes to break the seal and usher in a new era of wisdom and balance once again, and if you are willing to join them in doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4536;I will help you in this endeavour. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4537;[grand_master.GetTitledFirstName] nods in acknowledgement of your pledge and asks you swear loyalty to [grand_master.GetHerHim], grandmaster of the Enlightened, so that you may join their society and their work to build a better world in service of both Humanity and the Spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4538;Thank you, Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4539;You run back into the tundra as dark shadows emerge from the forest around you.

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4542;For a long time, you have considered yourself a just ruler, taking time to make sure things are settled fairly. At the sun sets, you sit beside the water, playing Pai-Sho.

EVTOPTC_MNSAK_4543;Unfortunate I could not have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4544;You sit and play a few games of Pai-Sho. It is clear [white_lotus_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] is an expert, always emerging the winner. As you play, you talk. [white_lotus_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] speaks of the necessity of well thought out strategy, not simply taking the most apparent move. [white_lotus_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] likens it to leadership, something you would be familiar with. [white_lotus_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] asks if you feel applying a similar philosophy to such matters is just as wise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4545_TOOLTIP;Invite §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to join the White Lotus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_4545;No, [From.GetTitledFirstName] still has much to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4546;Just as you finish your last game, [white_lotus_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] asks you if you ever had further interest in steering the wider world in a better direction.

If you are so willing, [white_lotus_recruiter.GetSheHe] would be more than happy to introduce you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4546;I'll meet this society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4548;I bid you safe journeys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4548_TOOLTIP;Your attempt to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to the White Lotus has succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4549;Accepting [white_lotus_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]'s invitation, you travel far to this society's chapter house.

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4549;Greetings to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4550;[grand_master.GetTitledFirstName] welcomes you inside the chapter house. There, over tea, [grand_master.GetSheHe] describes the many roles the White Lotus plays in the wider world and states that they have been watching you for a long time, seeing your potential to join their ranks. For it is the purpose of the White Lotus to preserve balance in the world, and to safeguard against any who would harm it, even the Avatar. Now, [grand_master.GetSheHe] asks if you are willing to play your own part in their noble part and join the White Lotus as a Sentry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4550;I shall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4550_TOOLTIP;You agree to join the §YWhite Lotus§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_4551;As one final requirement, [grand_master.GetTitledFirstName] asks you to swear loyalty to the White Lotus and their purpose in it's entirety. That you serve the society, uphold it's values in protecting peace in all four nations, and never divulge it's secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_4552;I bid you farewell, Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_4553;You hastily leave, watching your back every step it takes to return home. You say nothing because despite all of this, you know that no one will ever believe your tall tale of meeting the mythical White Lotus society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5092;After a week of correspondence, the wealth of knowledge your brethren promised you has arrived. There is so much that contradicts established information, and so much more of practical use.

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5094;You have spent more time researching the ancient world your brethren told you of, a time before the Avatar, nations or even the bending arts.

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5095;This may come in handy§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5096;As you gain trust among your fellow Enlightened, you become partial to more secrets the society holds.

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5144;After spending some time going through basic exercises, you feel the time has come to decide on an area you shall focus your efforts on. You can train yourself physically, or perhaps further hone your Firebending skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5144;I will undertake physical training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5144;I will undertake Firebending training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5144;I will learn Smokebending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5145;You have spent a week focusing on your physical training, focusing on both your strength as well as your agility as you train alongside your fellow sisters. It is taking it's toll however, and you're not sure whether you can keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5145;I'll give it my all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5145;I'll slow down a bit§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5146;You press hard to complete the most straining exercises your instructors give you, completing challenge after challenge. You emerge sore and aching, but far stronger for it. Is is without doubt that your physical strength is growing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5148;The weeks on intense training leave you sore and aching, and not really feeling you achieved much, failing to complete the last challenge set by your instructors. You made the effort, but it seems to have fallen short.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5148;I'm healthier, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5149;You have journeyed to practise your Firebending under the watchful eyes of senior members of the Sisterhood, who instruct you in more nuances of the art than you ever thought there were. Practising daily from sunrise to sundown, you find yourself pushed to the limit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5149;I must keep going!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5149;I need some time to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5150;After weeks of practising Kata after Kata, you have finally completed the final challenge set by your instructors, excelling at demonstrating your new-found ability. It is clear to all you have made a great and impressive advance in your bending abilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5150;Thank you, Masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5151;After endless days of exercise after exercise, you complete your final demonstration of your Firebending ability. While it is clear you have made good improvements, your instructors state that you still have not reached your limit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5151;I will try better next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5152;After endless days, practising without pause, your final demonstration of your Firebending abilities leaves your instructors unimpressed. They chastise you for not reaching your true potential. You have failed to improve your own abilities, but you feel this exercise has at least done you some good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5152;That helps at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5153;Today you begin your training to master the unique power of the Kemurikage Sisterhood, the ability to utilise your own Firebending to create smokescreens, allowing you to move and strike unseen. You are eager to know the secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5153;I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5154;After weeks of practise, you have finally mastered the technique, capable of not only creating your own smoke clouds, but how to breathe and manoeuvre through them when your opponent cannot. Now, you can use this skill for your advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5156;You have decided that something is to be done about [From.GetFullName] in order to preserve our realm's stability. You set out a number of various plans to deal with [From.GetHerHim], knowing just how you'll go about teaching [From.GetHerHim] a lesson§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5156;[From.GetFirstName] will do [From.GetHerHis] duty to the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5156;[From.GetFirstName] will be persuaded to see our lord's perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5156;[From.GetFirstName] should acknowledge [From.GetHerHis] lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5157;One night, you are jolted awake from your sleep, finding a dark shadow looming over you. You stare in shock, for it is a Spirit. It's inhuman voice speaks: [Root.GetFullName]. You anger us with your cruel and violent ways. You will atone, or face the consequences of your actions.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5157;Yes§ Yes! I will atone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5157;I will do whatever you say, Spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5158;You sweep in at the dead of night, waking [From.GetFullName] from [From.GetHerHis] sleep. Some smoke and dark words, and soon [From.GetFirstName] is vowing to atone for [From.GetHerHis] crimes to the Spirit [From.GetSheHe] believes you are. Successful in your mission, you vanish back into a cloud of smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5158;I'll hold you to your word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5159;The next morning, you hurriedly ask the Sages on how you could become a more honourable ruler, but leave out your terrifying encounter with the Spirits. The Sages are surprised, but give several suggestions on how you could right your wrongs. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5159;Whatever pleases the Spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5160;It takes a while for the news to reach you, but apparently, people are surprised that [From.GetFirstName] has recently had a sudden change of heart, now treating a great many people better. It seems you have put the fear of the Spirits into [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5160;A good night's work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5161;[From.GetFullName] does not take your late night intrusion well, screaming for the guards before you have the chance to speak. You hear the thunder of boots approaching, and decide whether to abandon this mission or to finish it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5161;We'll do this the hard way then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5161;I will escape quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNSAK_5161_Win;You emerge victorious over [From.GetFullName]'s guards and punish [From.GetHerHim] for his insolence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNSAK_5161_Failure;You are defeated by [From.GetFullName]'s guards and have to make a hasty escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5162;Your guards charge into the bedroom. You watch in horror as the Spirit makes short work of them, smoke spilling through the room until the guards collapse to the ground, gasping for breath. The Spirit turns back to you, and begins to float towards you§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5162;I surrender! I'll do whatever you say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5165;You move as the guards swarm in, creating plumes of smoke that weave with you through their spears. In seconds, the guards begin to collapse, unable to breath amongst the smoke. With them defeated, you turn back to your prey, who is now much more willing to hear what you have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5165;You will ATONE.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5163;Your guards storm into the room, raising spears the hooded figure. It explodes into a cloud of smoke, filling the room. When the smoke clears, the creature is gone, but a young guard shows you a bloodied spear tip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5163;It's no Spirit, just some lunatic§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5166;Guards pour into the room, and you find yourself overwhelmed. You create a curtain of smoke, obscuring your escape, but one of the guard's manages to wound you on the way out. You crawl away, undiscovered, but injured and a failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5166;Curse my foolishness§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5164;Your guards pour into the room, pointing their spears at the hooded figure. Your mysterious intruder simply vanishes into a cloud of smoke. When it clears, they are nowhere to be seen. The guards search, but fail to find the attacker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5164;No doubt just some lunatic§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5167;The guards charge in, but you make a quick escape, disappearing into a cloud of smoke before following your planned escape route. You disappear into the night, but sadly, you have failed your mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5167;I must be more prepared§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5168;You wake in a sudden to find a Spirit looming over you. The hooded figure looks down at you and speaks in an inhumanly deep voice: §[Root.GetFullName]. Have you forgotten your oath? Why do you not follow your lord and honour your ancestors?§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5168;You are right, Spirit. I have an oath§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5168;Guards! Get here at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5168;I will do as you ask, wise Spirit§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5169;You sweep in a dead of night, waking [From.GetFullName] to demand [From.GetSheHe] fulfil his oath to his liege and follow the correct path. A bit of smoke and dark words and [From.GetSheHe] accepts you as a divine messenger, promising to obey. Content, you slip away into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5169;My work here is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5170;The following morning, you accept the divine message the Spirits brought you. You hurriedly proclaim to follow the Firelord's footsteps and embrace the path that our majesty as set out for the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5170;This is what's right§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5171;You awaken in the night to find a dark, hooded figure looming over you. Hovering in the air like a Spirit, it speaks in an inhuman voice: §[Root.GetFullName]. You have dishonoured your ancestors by forgetting your oaths. You must make amends.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5171;If the ancestors believe so§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5171;Guards! Get in here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5171;I will Spirit! I will honour my lord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5172;You slip in at the dead of night, waking [From.GetFullName] to remind [From.GetHerHim] of [From.GetHerHis] duty to the ancestors. With some smoke and dark words, [From.GetFirstName] is ready to make amends for [From.GetHerHis] lack of loyalty. Content, you slip off into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5172;Remember that loyalty well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5173;The events of the previous night fresh in your memory, you write a letter to your liege, excusing for any lack of loyalty as of late and humbly offering up your future services if they are so needed. You must keep your oaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Why do you sow unnecessary death and chaos among your people? Why not swear fealty to the Lord of Fire? Is your pride worth this suffering?§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5175;This dream is an omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5175;Just some strange nightmare§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MNSAK_5175_TOOLTIP;You will swear fealty to the Firelord and renounce your independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5176;Slipping in during the darkest night, you whisper words to [From.GetFullName] in [From.GetHerHis] sleep. Waking, [From.GetFirstName] is convinced [From.GetSheHe] has been visited by a divine vision for the future, and begins to do as you ask, preparing to pledge loyalty to the Fire Nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5176;This is necessary for peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5177;You make preparations to travel to the great capital city of the Fire Nation, writing to the Firelord of your intent to swear fealty. The Firelord finds you sudden eagerness to join the growing Fire Nation strange, but readily accepts your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5177;The Firelord will lead us to a better future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5178;Without prelude, [From.GetFullName] arrives at your capital, offering fealty to the Fire Nation. [From.GetFirstName]'s reasoning is a bit strange, claiming to have a divine vision from the Spirits, but you readily accept this voluntary submission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5178;It is not my place to question the Spirit's will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5179;Slipping in during the darkest night, you whisper words to [From.GetFullName] in [From.GetHerHis] sleep. Waking, [From.GetFirstName] is troubled, but not convinced by the idea you planted. It seems you attempt to bring peace has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5213;You've trained every day for the past three weeks, completed every challenge and task set out to you by your masters. Finally, after a demonstration of your improved abilities, your master acknowledge your advancement. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5213;Thank you, for your teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5214;You decide to follow an alternative path, learning a new style of bending altogether than improving the one you already possess. The White Lotus is home to many great masters, so finding one to teach you this new style shouldn't be difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5215;I must use such power with wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5218;Presented with negotiating terms from a mysterious benefactor, you have no choice but to bring this uprising to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5218;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5219;It seems you're intervention in the recent uprising has worked. The rebel forces are disbanding, slowly bur surely, thanks to your influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5219;It was for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5220;Recently it has been brought to your attention that there are serious problems in a province of ours. Thoughts of rebellion are stirring and your sources say foreign agents are responsible. For whatever reason, things are getting quite out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5220;Curse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5221;Your latest efforts to sow insurrection among the personal lands of [From.GetFullName] seems to have worked, as your influence has brought discontent to an all time high. Rebellion isn't certain, but will be highly likely for quite some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5221;I merely worked with already existed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5223;For the past week, you have travelled to [From.GetFullName]'s court in order to investigate it for any enemies of the White Lotus and threats to the wider populace. It will take some time, especially being discrete, but if any such enemies exist, you will find them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5223;I feel nothing is strange here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5223;I feel something strange is afoot here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5224;After some weeks spent investigating [FromFrom.GetFullName]'s court, you cannot find any evidence of anything amiss. It seems things are fine here for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5224;I was worrying for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5225;After some weeks spent investigating [FromFrom.GetFullName]'s court, you become certain that there is some nefarious influence at work, one attempting to hide the presence of criminal elements here. You decide to investigate further, though there's no guarantee of success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5225;I'll see what I can find§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_IC_SUCCESS;you find undeniable evidence of wrongdoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_IC_ACCUSATION;you find some evidence of wrongdoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_IC_FAILURE;you fail to find any evidence of wrongdoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5226;A few weeks ago, a visitor by the name of [From.GetFullName] arrived, and has been getting into business where they don't belong. With your rather intolerable connections, you've decided to remain beyond suspicion, but today, two guards came before you, with orders to bring you for judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5226;They can't prove anything yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5228;A few weeks ago, a visitor by the name of [From.GetFullName] arrived, and has been getting into business where they don't belong. Thankfully, the investigation has been clumsy and foolish, and your societal connections have remained undetected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5228;What a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5229;After some time spent carefully investigating, your search has proven fruitless. Any time you get close to the truth, it turns into a dead end. It seems whatever has taken hold here has grown too powerful for you to discover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5229;I may yet return to finish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_ICO_NE_FAILURE;Your investigation has come to an unsuccessful end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_ICO_NE_SUCCESS;Your investigation has come to a successful end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5230;You have recently received correspondence from an anonymous source, revealing crucial information to you! It appears one of your courtiers, [From.GetFullName], is in fact part of a nefarious society known as [From.Society.GetName]. The evidence is damming and undeniable. You order [From.GetFirstName] brought before you for judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5230;For this, I order you imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_ICO_UE_SENTENCE;You will sentence [From.GetFullName] to imprisonment, so that you can deal with [From.GetHerHim] as you see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5230;I don't believe we can trust this source§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_ICO_UE_FAVOR;As a fellow member of [From.Society.GetName], you will destroy the evidence against [From.GetFullName], protecting your society from scrutiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5231;It seems you have not been able to slip away from this one. Your liege presents you with undeniable evidence of your involvement with [Root.Society.GetName], and sentences you to imprisonment for your association with this illegal organisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5231;Curse them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5232;It seems your investigation has come to a most fruitful success. You were able to anonymously inform [From.GetFullName]'s liege of [From.GetHerHis] criminal involvement with [From.Society.GetName] society. In response, [From.GetFirstName] has been imprisoned for this crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5232;A good day's work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5233;You are dragged before [From.GetFullName], who claims to have a letter detailing undeniable evidence of you're involvement with [From.Society.GetName]. Thankfully for you, [From.GetFullName] will be cleaning up those loose ends for you, lest [From.GetHerHis] own involvement becomes known. [From.GetSheHeCap] cautions you to be more careful in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5233;I'm thankful to have such well placed friends§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5234;It seems you investigation was for naught. Despite overwhelming evidence provided to [FromFrom.GetFullName], [From.GetFullName] has escaped any consequences. It seems [FromFrom.GetFullName] doesn§t trust your information, and has chosen not to act on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5234;So much time and effort, wasted§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5235;Recently, information has reached you that one of your courtiers, [From.GetFullName], is in fact a member of [From.Society.GetName]! To correct this travesty, you bring [From.GetHerHim] before you. The evidence is not compelling, but not acting on this may prove foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5235;If this is true, then I must deal with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5235;This is not proof enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WH_ICO_UE_DISAGRE;You do not trust this information, and choose to do nothing for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5235;Be more careful, will you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5236;It appears you may have been in some trouble, with [From.GetFullName] questioning you regarding your ties to [From.Society.GetName], with your quickly convince [From.GetHerHim] that whatever [From.GetSheHe] heard is but slanderous rumour. For now, [From.GetFirstName] appears to be willing to believe you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5236;A relief, to be sure§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5237;It appears your investigation was for naught, as all the evidence you've gathered is discretely provided doesn§t seem to be enough for [FromFrom.GetFullName] to be convinced that [From.GetFullName] has a nefarious agenda. To remain undetected, you must leave, your task unfinished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5237;Curse them! I must do better next time§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5061;To my esteemed [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have seen your Firebending skill in action, and wondered of your potential. You could learn so much more, if you simply joined the Agni Kai Society. If you don't, I fear you'd be squandering your potential.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5061;Of course I'll join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5061;I think I'm alright on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5062;To my esteemed [Root.GetFirstName],\nI'm happy to accept your invitation to join the Agni Kai. I look forward to proving myself worthy of the honour..\n\nSigned, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5062;A wise decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5063;To my esteemed [Root.GetFirstName],\nI'm afraid I'm going to have to decline your offer to join the Agni Kai. I'm just too busy at the moment with other, more important, matters.\n\nSigned, [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5063;A foolish choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5064;It seems [FromFrom.GetFullName] has taken a special interest in your Firebending training recently, personally attending your practices to give several pointers. Overall, you feel you have learned a great deal from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5064;Thanks for the help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5065;You've taken the opportunity to give [From.GetFullName] several Firebending lessons just between the two of you, and you are happy with the results. For all your work, [From.GetFullName] seems to be learning quite well and has made noticeable progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5065;The results are impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5066;After a week of giving it some thought, you believe you are ready to make the choice. What skill shall be the proof of your mastery of Firebending? Which masters will you seek out to impart their wisdom to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5066;I will learn to wield lightning itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_MNSAK_5066;I will learn to unleash my inner Chi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_MNSAK_5066;I will learn to channel my inner flame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5067;After spending several weeks atop the mountains with your fellow masters, you are finally ready. You step forward, raise your hand towards the sky and channel lightning from the heavens through your body, unleashing it to devastating results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5067;The power is unimaginable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5068;The ability to channel raw Chi energy is usually not one that is learned, but after sitting for several weeks with masters of Combustion-Bending and painful days of receiving tattoos all over your body, you are ready. You step forth and unleash a powerful burst of explosive energy from your forehead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5068;This is true power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5069;After weeks of meditation alongside Sages who carry down teachings from the original Firebending Masters themselves, you emerge feeling that you have developed a new understanding of Firebending, and your own inner flame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_MNSAK_5069;Wisdom is the path to strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5084;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI write to you to give some wholehearted advice. Form is only part of mastering Firebending.

EVTDESC_MNSAK_5087;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI have heard of your completion of the physical training I previously recommended to you and I congratulate you for it.

EVTOPT_MNSAK_5087;I am close, that is true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5088;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI write because I am watching your progress carefully.

If you win a practise match against a fellow member of our society, I'm sure they'll look more favourably upon you.\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MNSAK_5091;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n\nI write to coagulate you on your recent victory and to tell you that your fellow peers have most certainly noticed your potential.
