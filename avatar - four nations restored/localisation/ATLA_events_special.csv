EVTDESCspecial.1;As is customary for waterbender, training in the different techniques has been a part of your day from early childhood. Alas some techniques can't be learned, but can only be improved and perfected by years of training.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.1;Healing;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.1;I'm one of the lucky ones;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.2;Being part of the nomad culture of the sandbending tribes and an earthbender, means a large responsibility for the continuation of our culture. A large part of lives revolve around getting around the desert, but this can only be done by mastering sandbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.2;Sandbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.2;And today I was officially declared a sandbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.4;Alas, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been born blind. At first I hoped it would get better, but now I must accept the terrible fate that has befallen my beloved [From.GetSonDaughter].;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.4;A terrible tragedy strikes!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.4;I must do whatever I can to protect my [From.GetSonDaughter];;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.5;I might be blind, but luckily my other senses has been heightened significantly as a result. Since I was born blind, I've never known the color of the sky or the skylines of the cities. But being an earthbender has allowed me to sense the small vibrations in the ground. Since then I've tried my best to utilize this to my advantage.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.5;I learn seismicsense;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.5;It is almost as I can see!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.6;The Firelords were selected as the leaders of this mighty nation because of their superior innate bending potential. As a Firelord, this is a heavy legacy to live up to, and on one point I have failed - lightningbending. After consulting the foremost spiritual sages, the power flows through me as ever before.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.6;Ancient powers;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.6;I'm a lightningbender as my ancestors!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.7;As Firelord and a lightningbender I have decreed that every firebending academy in my nation is obligated to arrange courses in lightningbending. Hopefully this drastic step will strengthen our benders and push our nation into a new era!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.7;A drastic step;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.7;Hopefully I did the right thing...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.8;The benevolent Firelord has forced the firebending academies to learn the students lightningbending. Despite a lot of injuries among the students and teachers, I'm one of the lucky ones, who have managed to learn it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.8;Lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.8;I'm one of the lucky ones;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.10;[From.From.GetFirstName] has been pacing and pushing me hard for some time. To master lightningbending isn't an easy task, but I have finally learned how to control ;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.10;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.10;I feel the energy surge through me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.11;A calm and stable mind is essential for mastering lightningbending. During one of the sessions with [From.From.GetFirstName] I became overeager. The surge of energy that ran through my body couldn't be controlled and I didn't manage to release it proberly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.11;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.11;I do not think I will be able to train for a while.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.12;To master lightningbending one has to master a complete stable and calm mind. Achieving this was easier said than done, and as a result nothing has come of my training.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.12;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.12;Hopefully I get to try another time.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.13;[From.From.GetFirstName] has appoached about mastering lightningbending. Mastering lightningbending has made [From.From.GetFirstName] one of the worlds best benders, but I'm aware of the dangers it carry.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.13;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.13;I will begin my training;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.13;I dare not take the risk!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.14;The training I offered my [GetFromRelation] has carried great results and I'm now more respected;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.14;That is great to hear;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.15;Training my [GetFromRelation] has taken a terrible turn of events. In [From.GetHerHis] eagernes [From.GetSheHe] was hurt bad.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.15;What a terrible thing!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.16;Mastering lightningbending is a difficult task and unfortunately, now everyone is cut out to handle the energy. This turned out to be the case here, sadly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.16;A waste of time...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.17;Feeling the earth move with each vibration has given me an unique insight in how to control each part of the earth. As I have enhanced this technique I've come to a startling realization. Metal contains small parts of earth, which I can bend to my will.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.17;Metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.17;I can bend metal now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.18;What exciting times we live in! An earthbender has revealed to the world, the ability to change the form of metal to their will. This could lead to new discoveries.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.18;Soon whole cities will be made of metal!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.19;After some time trying to master metalbending from [From.From.GetFirstName] I have finally managed to bend this resilient metal to my will;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.19;Finally!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.20;Despite [From.From.GetFirstName]'s warnings, I decided to try to stop a metal pole being thrown at me. Unfortunately I didn't manage to catch it :(;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.19;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.20;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.20;Guess I aren't as good a catch as I thought..;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.21;Sometimes training isn't enough. Learning to control small particles of earth within a purified metal is like catching a specific butterfly with chopsticks. It is no shame I failed at this.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.21;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.21;It is difficult.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.22;[From.From.GetFirstName] has offered to teach me a highly advanced technique. Bending the earth within metal. An almost impossible feat, which  does contain some risk during the hard training.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.22;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.22;I will take on the challenge;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.22;I would rather not risk it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.23;After training [From.GetRelation] [From.GetFirstName], [From.GetSheHe] has learned metalbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.23;During training, we spend much time in each others company.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.24;Training metalbending can sometimes be dangerous. Sometimes the reward is equal to the risk. This time my student has been injured.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.24;Perhaps it wasn't worth it...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.25;Metalbending has never been an easy discipline to learn. None the less I deemed [From.GetFirstName] to be capable of learning it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.25;This time I was wrong...;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.26;Being captured and held against my will has allowed me a lot of free time. As a waterbender, the guards are naturally careful of giving my access to water. As the time has gone, I have noticed an increasing power during the full moon and it is like I can feel the life around me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.26;I will start to use my powers on small rodents.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.26;I'm a good person. I can't do that.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.27;The last two weeks I have tried to control the water in small rodents. Some of them unfortunately died as a result, but I finally have some control of it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.27;I can't stop now. Seeing the small creatures in pan will help me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.27;Better to stop now. This is too cruel.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.28;After more time, I have finally managed to have full control of the rodents. The next full moon could very well be my chance to escape.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.28;I will try to escape at the next full moon!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.28;Controlling another human being is just too cruel.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspecial.28;I'm free, so no need to escape!;;;;;;;;;
TOOLTIPAspecial.28;You will try to escape soon.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.29;As soons as the night dawns, I fake cramps in my left leg. As expected, two guards come by to see what the fuss is about. As sudden as my cries stopped, the guards' cries were heard down the hall, as I slammed them together, before using one of them to hand over the key. I turn the key and the door springs open. As I rush through the prison I have to make a decision.;;;;;;;;;,,,,,
EVTOPTAspecial.29;I will search for the prison warden;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.29;I shall search for a safe escape route.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.30;I'm killed;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.30;Nothing;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.31;I came upon the prison ward and after a short fight I managed to incapacitate [From.GetHerHim]. I used [From.GetHerHim] as a shield as I escaped, but an unfortunate arrow from my captors rendered [From.GetHerHim] useless.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.31;At least I escaped.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.32;Apparantly [From.GetFirstName] tried to escape my prison. This can't go unpunished, with further deprivation of water.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.32;Let me see you escape this!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.33;A strange report from my prison has reached me. Apparently a prisoner escaped. Not through bending, but by controlling people with a waive of a hand.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.33;Surely they are covering their own mistakes.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.29;Bloodbender tries to escape;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.35;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was killed during [From.From.GetFirstName]'s escape from my prison. Apparently [From.From.GetFirstName] could control the guards.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.35;Will [From.From.GetSheHe] come for me now?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.36;Seeing animals and humans in pain has brought me much pleasure. Recently I have started to push my control over small animals further than ever before, by using my waterbending. Slowly it dawned upon me, that these creatures consist of water too. After going through a lot of animals, I have finally perfected my bloodbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.36;Cruel bloodbender;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.36;Perhaps I can control humans as well?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.36;Total control is boring.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.37;Bloodbender revealed;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.37;Recently there has been reports of [From.GetFirstName], a powerful bender, who has managed to control other people by controlling the water in people.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.37;That is worringly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.38;Training bloodbending is difficult, because of the very nature of the technique. Despite my initial rejections of the technique, I have finally mastered it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.38;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.38;I'm a bloodbender now.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPAspecial.29;You find the wardens office!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPBspecial.29;In the search for the wardens office, reinforcements arrive and subdues you.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPCspecial.29;You escape and get back home.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPDspecial.29;Despite searching for several hours, I've found no exit and has been subdued by the guards.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.39;To master bloodbending, one have to have felt it on your own body, to know how it feels to control another person. During one of these sessions, my trainer [From.From.GetFirstName] made a mistake and broke my leg.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.39;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.39;I don't dare bloodbend again.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.40;Controlling another human being is something that takes an enormous amount of effort and control over the element. Sadly I haven't managed to achieve those things,;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.40;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.40;Perhaps it is for the better.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.41;[From.From.GetFirstName] has approached me and thinks of sharing one of the darkest secrets of waterbending with me. Learning bloodbending is hard and can even be dangerous.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.41;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.41;I'm willing to take the risks;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.41;I'm not prepared to learn this dark secret;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.42;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has managed to master the art of controlling another living being against it's will.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.42;I'm so proud;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.43;During a training session, where I controlled [From.GetFirstName] I made a mistake and broke [From.GetHerHis] leg.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.43;[From.GetSheHeCap] probably won't walk again. ;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.44;Despite huge efforts from both sides, my protégé hasn't managed to master bloodbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.44;Not all has it in them.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.45;After careful consideration I have decided to give up my control over other living being.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.45;I already feel much better.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.46;After giving up my earthly tethers, I'm finally ready to fly among the birds and the skybisons.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.46;Flight;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTSpecial.46;I feel light as a feather.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.47;As a firebender I have a great control over the element. As time has progressed, my understanding of the element has become better. A simple solution to a simple problem. How to put as much power in a single strike as possible. I have finally managed to compress the firepower in a single shot, concentrated from my head.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.47;Combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.47;It is a fearsome technique.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.48;Combining and forcing so much force through a single point carries a great risk. Fortunately I have managed to control it very well and am now able to control it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.48;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.48;I'm a combustionbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.49;Forcing a large amount of energy through a single point just above the eyes carries a great risk. An imbalance in my chi made an explosion which sent me back several meters.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.49;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.49;I won't be able to bend for some time!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.50;Despite my best efforts, I haven't been able to control my chi enough to channel the energy towards my head. Even though I didn't learn it, at least I avoided an explosion just in front of my face.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.50;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.50;Perhaps it is for the best.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.51;My [From.GetFromRelation] [From.From.GetFirstName] has decided I'm worthy of the challenge of learning to challenge my chi to the head and fire a powerful shot against my opponents.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.51;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.51;I will take the risk of the training;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.51;I would rather not risk it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.52;As a result of hard work [From.GetFirstName] has managed to learn to fire a single shot of intense energy against [From.GetHerHis] enemies.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.52;I'm so proud;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.53;Combustionbending is a dangerous bending technique and unfortunately my dear [From.GetFirstName] hurt [From.GetHerHis] head as a result of a single mistake.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.53;It's a dangerous world.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.54;Despite our best efforts, [From.GetFirstName] has not learned to master combustionbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.54;It's a difficult technique.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.55;Moving the earth creates tensions in the surface. Tensions which could be utilized in combat if used right. Obviously ripping a tear in the earth's crust requires a lot of energy, but after a lot of training I have finally managed to control it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.55;Lavabending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.55;I'm a lavabender now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.56;Despite of the peaceful teachings of the Air Nomads, sometimes more violent measures must be taken to enforce the peace of the world. As an airbender I have managed to draw the air itself out of anyone who might prove a threat.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.56;Voidbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.56;I'm a voidbender.;;;;;;;;;
